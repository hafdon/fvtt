They were companioned by one Lum Gorbelly, an untidy gnoll wearing a white skullcap which party obscured a large scar traversing his face. Flick confessed to a small crush on Thaz, which Lum, a moody fellow, ignored graciously. Travel to Marshbout was short and uninterrupted, except by occasional refrications and anxieties of the parasitic nature of Thubudder Farrest. Just as Joan betrayed a worrisome inclination towards fulgurous snorts, fueled by Flick's relentless hot air, the two passed through the stout walls of Famasta Monastery, into its homey cobblestoned courtyard, and took a moment to admire the heavy slate roof and cracked grotesques weighing down the </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">sobor </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">(main monastic building) and set off nicely by the creamy stucco walls and stained glass windows.

Aiming to impress, Carlos donated his healing prowess to the gnolls still convalescing from that morning's attack. To his dismay, it became clear that whatever power hurt the gnolls would require more profound intervention. Ready to move on, but soured on and suspicious of the quest to locate Lupenna, Flick nevertheless led the group northeast, towards the Grey Tongue and Castle Karn, where the gentlest path led up to an abbey surrounded by hundreds of close-set wooden crosses set in the hardscrabble ground.

Amalia, Rotrude, and Laceleaf Deadies From The Past. Accusations turn to blows.</div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div>## Xanthu(c) Diaspora, Heironymus’s knowledge thereof</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- doubt that they were bagpipe players</div>\n<div>- most were humans</div>\n<div>- some of them probably used mules as beasts of burden</div>\n<div>- about 54% chance of you coming across living inhabitants of these villages if you went off to search for them</div>\n<div>- how would they greet adventurers?&nbsp;</div>\n<div> - they'd be shocked you got out of the temples, or weren't turned into slaves or sacrifices</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## The Chamber of Xanthu</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Angela establishes XANTHU as the antagonist in a scooby doo cartoon. When \"These rocks look great\" wore out he merged back into the wall.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Exploring the subterranean chamber</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero wants to shimmy down the column supporting him, which is the exact shape of his body. He slides carefully down, lowering himself from the edge of the column to where it is safe for him to jump on the rubble below.</div>\n<div>- Drav hangs from the temple floor and jumps down.</div>\n<div>- They can see the far end of the chamber to a set of stairs which proceed further down. Drav's [Perception 20] notices that the floor is irregular and not level. She discerns a kind of intaglio physiognomy, as though a huge face is emerging.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jake: was Xanthu upstairs scary or beautiful? DM: he was utilitarian in appearance.</div>\n<div>- Drav [Arcana 5] is slightly apprehensive that the floor-face might come to life; but, upstairs, Xanthu's face and vitality were synchronic.</div>\n<div>- Carlos drops nimbly into the chamber.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Amalia Broadbeam</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- [Perception !25] Amongst the rubble and kobold body parts is a newly made pair of leather boots connected to legs. [Athletics 19] Carlos shoulders away the boulders and crushed and amputated limbs, gradually uncovering the body of an unconscious dwarf. [Intelligence 7] Carlos realizes this is his old friend, Amalia Broadbeam. When Carlos would travel to heal communities, you would often travel together. She was a practiced carpenter; you would both build stone and wooden structures, build hospitals, dig wells and irrigation troughs. [Medicine good] She's not breathing, but she is moving, making small regular motions; her hands tremble slightly and her mouth is moving as if to mumble in dream. Carlos tries Spare the Dying, which has no effect on the dwarf.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Suddenly she opens her eyes. Amalia is very confused to be underground; the last thing she remembers is building a shelter for halflings at the mouth of a cave in the Braided Mountains next the Talion Valley.</div>\n<div>- Carlos confirms she isn't injured and reassures her of her safety.</div>\n<div>- Hiero walks over with his shortsword and offers to put her out of her misery.</div>\n<div>- Carlos waves him off and tells Amalia he's a weirdo.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: \"having that little hair on my head would drive me to suicide\"</div>\n<div>- Heiro: \"The only sense in which i'm weird is that I'm your fate if you are not careful.\"</div>\n<div>- Amalia is shocked and bemused that he's invoking the ideas of the Old Gods, and asks where he learned about it.</div>\n<div>- Heiro, \"I spent many years studying under the great elf Horoxicron, who taught me many things, among them, the arcana of the weird dragons of Persipoly.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Oh, -- the dragon notions are different than ours, but they still have Weirds?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: the dragons are actually the ones controlling the gods that once lived in this temple.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: what temple?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Rotrude Meletorix</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Coming up the stairs at the end of the passageway Hiero sees Rotrude, another elf who was also an ascetic.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- She looks similar to the last time Heiro saw her. Wearing a periwinkle skullcap, beautiful dark blue with vertical white lines cassock, and double-strapped monk boots. However, she's dripping wet. [Intelligence 11] Last he saw Rotrude, she drowned in a lake nearby. THey were out together; he can't quite remember what they were doing. Maybe she got too deep in the lake, or maybe Hiero had tripped and brought her down with you. She was drowned and dead before the monks could revive her.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude approaches Hiero. \"Fine, you got me,\" Hiero reluctantly confirms his identity just as he notices her blood-red eyes.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Rotrude, can it really be you? And look at those contacts!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: On the contrary, i've had contact with very few since ... it was only a few minutes ago that we last saw each other. I came up out of the lake and you were gone. We had been fishing and reminiscing about your parents, Gorenchim and Weldemoet.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: please don't bring them up.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude, yes, it did get quite heated.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: \"who is that ... and who are the rest of you?\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Most are my friends, except for the new one.</div>\n<div>- Fez finishes his seaweed jerky and hears too many people talking below.</div>\n<div>- Carlos, \"Is there any jerky left? Dangit!\"</div>\n<div>- Fez, somewhere deep in his subconscious, begins to contemplate braiding together the grape and seaweed jerky.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Fez drops in</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez, \"There's a bit of a crowd down here\" [Perception 23].&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav had discovered a secret door in the far corner of the temple floor; Fez sees a chainmail hood off of which glitters chartreuse light emanating from the stairway, as though a body is coming headfirst into the passageway.</div>\n<div>- \"Well if it isn't Fezziwig Hornswoggle. My dearest 20th 1st cousins four times removed.\"</div>\n<div>- Fez, \"Why are you here? family reunions are every five years and we just had one last year\"</div>\n<div>- A short discussion of identity ensues unfruitfully</div>\n<div>- I'm one of the Wortpullers, Laceleaf. (She lives in Torffeton 50 miles west? east? of Cressida, a little halfling town near the Gath Valley and Toofy Lake)</div>\n<div>- Carlos expresses disappointment that Fez has so many relatives.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez Divine Sense: These are all undead (he can't tell about Laceleaf, she's too far away)</div>\n<div> - Fez is uncomfortable with how far away he can sense things. BUT HE'S NOT SCARED.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: am i getting the heebie jeebies from the elf?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez [Intelligence 15]: her parents, Freetricia and Elbow Wortpuller, were ailing, and she left them home alone; she wanted to go out and carouse with friends and 19th-21st cousins, 61 times removed ?? The town was struck by an unpredictable snowstorm, and they died. Her brother, went out and it was rumored that he was going to bring her back or something worse. This got to you second or third hand.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez says BRAVELY: I think ... our friends ... don't seem to be alive. Currently.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: hey, what are you trying to say??</div>\n<div>- Fez: I agree, this resembles my cousin. But just ... can't you smell it? And Carlos notices the smell.</div>\n<div>- Fez is WIGGED OUT BUT STOIC</div>\n<div>- Rotrude and Laceleaf start walking towards you</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: Fez, I know that you left your parents back home, just to farm without you. That's not a great idea. You should take care of family.</div>\n<div>- Fez: they can take care of themselves.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: that's what i thought, but they need their kids.</div>\n<div>- Fez: sometimes you have to go your own way.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: i'm gonna make sure you get back to your folks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## The Parent (and Cousin and Friend) Trapped&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Xanthu: I TOLD YOU YOU'D HAVE TO HELP ME, and the rubble rises to re-form the ceiling/floor&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez is so perceptive that he gets a free action before combat. He activates his heelys&nbsp;</div>\n<div> - by the sea, i'll return you to the depths one way or another, and casts Blessing of the Sea</div>\n<div>- they yell about what \"depth\" means</div>\n<div>- in the conversational commotion, some leeches fall out of Rotrude's ear</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Combat</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez divine smites Rotrude</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: If only you used your whip as a flog, I might have supplicated myself in punishment before the divine.</div>\n<div> - moderately sexually compelling to Hiero. Only about 300 years old</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Forgive my skepticism, but the last time we saw each other, you were dead, and the real Rotrude only wore one strap on her boots. If i could put you to a test. I'm going to play a tune on the bagpipes, and you play the next note (he plays three notes and hands her the bagpipes)</div>\n<div>- Rotrude can't breathe, so no air goes into the bladder. \"I think it is clogged?\"&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro shakes the instrument, and a ballgag drops out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I have this extra bootstrap, and you have that extra strap. it angers me that you would call into question my authenticity.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: what were your last words?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: how i felt your parents' life of fishing and religious obligation was sufficient, but i could sense in you a great anger. and then you said \"Die----\" which i assume was the first syllable</div>\n<div>- Heiro: yes, i was going to say \"Dining out with you later \"</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: dining out? you have been captured by the urban civilization that lives outside of our walls.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: what, in the last five minutes?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: spiritual devotion doesn't mean much if you're not tempted to dine out sometimes</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, in the absence of temptation, we submit ourselves to punishment, through which we may demonstrate our commitment to the divine</div>\n<div>- Heiro: so you want a self-flagellation-off?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, and this halfling's whip would do nicely.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## Request a whipping</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Heiro tries to get Fez to whip him. Fez looks back at Rotrude, who looks interested in how it plays out, and is calming a bit: Fez: ok, prep yourself.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: why are you so hairy?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: yes, this is evidence i've been living a hard life out here. it's not like it is in the cloisters. as they say, you have to \"grow some hair on your bottom\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos: also ... a tree cast a spell on us</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: probably you just haven't chafed off the hair from walking extensively as you should be doing. in the absence of that, your friend must whip it off you.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: ok, but then you have to whip yourself harder!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: This is our way!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>## A simple crown</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: to fez: I'm gonna have to make sure you come back with me to take care of your folks. Just lemme put this little circlet on your head (Crown of Madness but reflavored).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro puts it together that this reddish-gold metal matches the description of the metal deposit that the archaeologists were telling you about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- The crown dissolves over Fez's head.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: I know you're not one for ornamentation, but that crown was gonna help you figure out what to do in life.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm not one for a heavy head.</div>\n<div>- `Laceleaf: It's grief and your subconscious regret that give you a heavy head!`</div>\n<div>- Carlos: All this extra hair is heavy enough.</div>\n<div>- Carlos gets in touch with Aulë, who tells him it's ok to kill the undead.</div>\n<div> - Nothing against old people, but we're against the undead.</div>\n<div> - invokes Turn Undead and undead turn to begin running, as the ducttape on Carlos's spiritual hammer shines like burnished silver which expands in a spiral and frightens the undead with holy light.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude brags about how hurt she is and then disappears down the stairs.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Disappear like you always do!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I have always been there for you, Heironymus. I have taught you much of what you know. You were very precocious.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I already knew that! I just enjoyed spending time with your pet lizards. I mean leeches.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I had a pet leech.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What kind of leech?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I liked catching worms to keep as pets in the ponds outside the cave. I brought back a leech and then minnows ate it.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: have you been traumatized?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I think so?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, Heiro, you were heartbroken when my lizards died until i got replacements for them.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I still have them ?!</div>\n<div>- `&nbsp;…???`</div>\n<div>- Carlos: hey amalia, you're running away, do you understand what's happening?</div>\n<div>- Amalia: You're emitting some kind of evil energy, and the closer i try to get the more it hurts me.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: All i did was cast a spell that affects undead.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Oh, one of your clerical spells?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Yes ... although I'm not sure it was worth it. But it implies you might be dead.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Yes, I needed help supporting a beam, and you stepped away for a moment, and ... then you pulled me out of this rubble. Do you just want to put distance between us, to break up?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I only cast it as a test</div>\n<div>- Amalia: You're already testing the relationship!</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Well I do see myself as a scientist. Medicine occupies the middle ground between science and religion.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Yes, Aulë was very close-minded about who you could spend time with.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Drav, did you ever kill someone by accident? Why isn't there one of these things for you?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Drav doesn't like letters (see: correspondent)</div>\n<div>- Drav doesn't recall -- it's a little hard to remember things.</div>\n<div>- You're all _pretty_ sure you're remembering real things.</div>\n<div>- Drav: Can we check to see if there's something altering our mental states.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm pretty sure I didn't kill laceleaf.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I feel really guilty. I don't like it. I want it to be spread around.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm just supposed to feel guilty about abandoning my family.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I definitely killed that lady. But in my defense she was being really annoying in bringing up my parents.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude (from below): Heiro, YOU started that conversation.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: can we address the rock face on the floor?</div>\n<div>- [Drav and Carlos attempt to communicate with Xanthu]</div>\n<div>- XANTHU: these creatures are of your acquaintance. It's difficult even for me to tell what's pulled from your psychic fingerprints and what is \"real\"</div>\n<div>- Drav: Why did you say we would help you? Have these creatures appeared to others?</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: I have used this technique before. But what I referred to was the death of the Queen of the Sun -- i do not need you to be impressed; i don't need the approval of mortals;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: what do you need from us?</div>\n<div>- Drav: Why did you call out to us?</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: It's what I see as one of the fundamental breaches [impediments] between you and a fundamental understanding of yourself. I need you to revitalize the empire that was here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div> - the kobolds would be useful as sacrifices. they were unable to establish a working relationship with the guardians before angering them.</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: well i can't do anything further until you synthesize these threats [either prove yourselves strong enough here, or … fail.]</div>\n<div>- Drav: what about me? i don't have anyone to synthesize.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: I don't always specifically create these counterparts. There must be something here for you too. Or maybe you're already perfect. (chuckles)</div>\n<div>- Hiero, covered in soot and rubble, attempts to convince Xanthu that he is a rock monster. (Interestingly, he fails to use Xanthu's name: one of the many reasons it could be said that he failed to convince the god.) \"Basement floor! Ooooooh! It is I, Terence, your baby brother, who you allowed to drink mead at 10 years old, and fell off a parapet to my death! Woooooooooooooooooo!\"</div>\n<div>- Terence, is that you! Come towards my eyes so that I may see you!</div>\n<div>- Heiro trips on a rocky outcropping on the floor and goes sprawling into where the mouth concavity was.</div>\n<div>- Drav casts obsidian shards on Laceleaf.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf's eyes burn bright red, \"If I'm gonna hurt, you're gonna hurt too\"</div>\n<div> - Drav gets Hellish-Rebuked. red flames with burning white core.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos, are you just trying to punish me for a relationship peccadillo ?</div>\n<div> - Carlos: it's just the circumstances! i don't think we can hang out anymore. i'm not even sure you're who you think you are. this rock demi-god</div>\n<div>- Amalia: do you mean Melkaro, the dwarven god?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: no, it's some other weird thing.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Well we should take you to a healer, you're so confused. Come with me so I can take care of you.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I ...</div>\n<div>- Amalia: I have no doubt you'll act independently, going off to pray to Aulë, rubbing your hammer.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Don't even think about coming near me; I'll slit your throat.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: prefers to just kill or just talk. So he attacks Laceleaf.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- [Laceleaf criticizes Fez's whip and Hellish Rebukes him. And then gets confused with metaphors. \"coming back by not going back\" -- Laceleaf is bad at telling stories and prefers partying.]</div>\n<div>- [Fez tries to convince her she's undead. Laceleaf learned how to throw fire being close to Moradin's forge in Torffeton, having volcanic power running through our bones]</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Ki-fueled strike. Dagger &amp; unarmed strike.</div>\n<div> - Laceleaf: who's this gross piece of shit? and starts shading Hiero.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf pulls out a 3 foot long bowie knife as Hiero runs away, wrenches a shield from one of the dead kobold's hands, pulling off the hand, and shouting ... something .&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf licks the scimitar, spreading a greenish-white saliva over the blade. Fez tries not to think about it, but is pretty convinced she covered it in poison.</div>\n<div> - [Ability: Saliva trick]</div>\n<div>- \"Your wiley friend there distracted me\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos attacks Laceleaf with his warhammer and conjures his spiritual weapon.</div>\n<div>- Fez attacks with divine smite attacks Laceleaf, who belittles his whip and Hellish Rebukes.</div>\n<div> - \"I hope you burn to death just like my parents froze to death\"</div>\n<div> - \"The earth was our class, and geometry was our professor, so I know all there is to know\"</div>\n<div>- also if you lose a cousin, you also have to discount a cousin you do have</div>\n<div>- \"What is the lungs but two holes that don't go nowhere?\"</div>\n<div>- Fez: Halflings can never turn down a dare to eat</div>\n<div>- [They start getting in on education and existentialism]</div>\n<div>- Heiro tosses Carlos a poison since Carlos wanted to see if Laceleaf could eat anything.</div>\n<div> - He runs behind her, mixes bat guano and sulfur in his mouth, and dips finger in bile lighter fluid and fireballs her.</div>\n<div> - He thus starts coronavirus</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf takes damage from fireball but almost gets out of the way.&nbsp;</div>\n<div> - I have beautiful hair, thank you very much, you can't see it because of the chain mail hood I'm wearing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf trashes Fez with her bowie knife and wrathful smite. \"Maybe I'll even embrace this warm fighting\"</div>\n<div>- Drav spontaneously passes out.</div>\n<div>- Back up to Fez -&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Then Hiero does faerie fire with remainder of mouth fire, but Laceleaf avoids it because it was too weak, \"looks like you're too weak to even spit right\"</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf murders out cold Fez, grabs him by the ankle, and starts walking towards the stairs, leaving Rotrude's leeches behind. Fez's blood is too coagulated for the leeches to get in.</div>\n<div> - and Fez was always taught to keep your mouth closed when you fall unconscious</div>\n<div>- Carlos Preserve Life's Fez.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez trips Laceleaf who falls on her own sword and dissolves into a greenish-white puddle of salivary \"gluids\".</div>\n<div></div>"}

They demurred slightly when considering the arrangement in retrospect, but Isabella remained convinced that she couldn't have tended the castle in her true form without causing terror amongst the townsfolk. Flick retired rather than adumbrate a detailed genealogy with her godmother and half-aunt, and the gang awoke the next morning to delicious stacked pancakes and an invitation to assist Isabella with research into Boggshosh, the elder god. Drav and Paros, delighted by the offer, perused old tomes with Carlos at the ready in case of overexertion. Drav, ever in command of her faculties, discovered texts on the ancient rituals of Boggshuosh cultists and a loose leaf from a memoir concerning Sirmgalv, a quasi-mythological world-tree. Paros, lost in contemplation, was Veenock'ed around and put in mind of a primeval rivalry between the evil spirit and the demon Nundocamar; he was further tasked with the recovery of an onyx ring with great psionic powers.</p>\n<p>Flick and Joan, meanwhile, took advantage of the crisp fall air and trekked to the North Tower, which they discovered to be more of a waystation for happenstansical travelers. Flick immediately ransacked the workshed and pilfered a pair of sealskin gloves and an unexpectedly strong rope woven out of fizzlecyst silk. Joan, convinced the tower housed eggs in need of protection, attempted to open the door from the downside up, and in so doing alerted the resident, Hale Clotwool, who introduced herself as a herder. Greeted also by the music inside (Straight out the butte: never gonna' plateau, by The Young Fustics), the smells of a rich second breakfast, and the inquisitive head of a laid-up turr named Orbell Daedonbashur, Joan and Flick assisted in repairing the door and casing the joint. Flick's heightened conusance of portalian japery, however, shattered the placid free-for-all and brought her face to face with an avatar of Juniper Three School; together they inferred that the reddish-gold ingots were somehow altering the planar coherence around Egg Three School.</p>\n<p>By early afternoon everyone had reconvened at Castle Karn, just in time to witness an efflorescent belch of petals aflame exploding from Tobolux's berninde. It took Paros's increasingly worrisome familiarity with Veenock to make an assay at the truth: demonic BaphOMO got sloppy attempting to influence the current cosmological detente on Thuslubber<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/5#fn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;and killed some 'weak and tasty'&nbsp;bloemenwet. Domonkos and Lupenna, unbothered by the general goings-on, began to draft up the details for an immortal castle timeshare, and the group headed towards&nbsp;An Sráidbhaile. It quickly became necessary to implement 'ghost fog protocol,' involving, in part, mental exercises to prevent subconscious resentment of people considered mediocre; but, even perceptive Flick was taken unawares upon stumbling into Grenlich's immor. As Joan rushed forward to embrace the future of humanoid-manity, the other adventurers did what they could to injure the poor unfortunate gnoll, in pain, in need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dbut\">Début</h2>\n<hr />\n<section><ol><li id=\"fn1\"><p>The isthmus which encloses Snaff Bay west of Marshbout.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/5#fnref1\">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>"}

This latter approach proved its merit, when Thaz, a stealthy outposted guard, got the drop on Flick's hedge-creeping. The magician Mezlar brokered systatic [commendatory] introductions of not only the gnolls but a greedy pig named Gribble which Carlos believed to be out of Paros's romantic league. After Thaz impressed them with hearty calisthenics, Mezlar offered as bivouac the empty home of a recently deceased community member. Flick, ever the detective, described the \"fetus mushrooms\" seen earlier that day to Mezlar, who instantly recognized the object detailed. One of the gnolls, Kolmy Shortpaw, had, a few months ago, moved north of the village near an expanse of desecrated ruins, and renamed herself Grenlich. The gnolls had been rooting out and burning the hodmandods, but a report of them so far from the village was worrisome; such expansion indicated that Grenlich, once trained by Mezlar's father in techniques now forsworn by the village, could become a sore threat soon.</p>\n<p>Mining Mezlar further for renseignements, the group learned that Joan's black orb could instantly impart a year's worth of solid core training to one employing its power, and that the material substance of Flick's figuring bore similarities to an onyx-like stone quondam [formerly] mined nearby. At this point, Joan ceremoniously burned Dravita in the town bonfire, and everyone, exhausted by recent travails, betook themself of a nocturnal rest.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Flick abraided [awoke] to the cool 'magical cleansing' tongue of 'Jasper and the Lady Violet' (<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-157e22db-7fff-584b-df9d-5a77955c35fc\">An intelligent horse who lives with gnolls; a practiced surveyor and mathematician</span></p>\n<p>) and its porcine friend. Trivialities were soon shoved aside, though, as a gnoll trapper was carried into town having had his heart torn out and a bevy of winged hodmandods flew into the village, petrified most of the congregated with horrendous shriek, and made to extract the life-force from the dead trapper. A misplaced lightning bolt from Joan allowed one of the creatures to bud a landbound form, and in the fight at least one gnoll was splashed with a sticky ichor before the monsters could take flight. Hoping to provide aid, the adventurers met with Brak Shortpaw, sister to Komy and resident Lorekeeper, who revealed that the trapper's heart had been removed by a not unfamiliar harpy-like creature, and that the appearance of the hodmandods likely an unfortunate coincidence. Apprised of these new developments, the gang took a moment to regroup and steel themselves for their next step.</p>\n<p>**<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cda8b283-7fff-ce14-5826-a45e6080090d\">— Hingleburt Tauncelledonque, esq.</span></p>\n<p>**</p>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>"}

[Deception 11]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The nearest elph to Jean-luc, Dalpholph sweet navy blue mohowk wearing horizontally striped green and orange robes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Dalpholph: What makes you think that an agent wielding the Star of Tepplin can exercise any authority here?&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[History 11] Jean-luc recognizes the name Tepplin; he knows it not to be a religious symbol. He knows enough about what it isn’t to recognize that what Dalpholph has said about its impotence here is probably correct.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Where I’m from, Tepplin is revered.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Dalpholph: Oh, so you’re from Albland. Seems a bit mercantilist to revere the star of a well-known brewer and distiller out in Albland.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: They make a really good brew; and it turns out that these people are wanted because they’ve been trying to steal our secret recipe. [Persuasion (could have been Deception again) 21].&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Dalpholph: It’s not like us to respect intellectual property in that way? I’ve been hearing a lot about it, too: People laying claim to secret recipes rather than putting them in the open. That’s a risk that Baronian takes: if the recipe is secret, and he doesn’t patent it, then if it’s stolen, that’s it.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc [Roll for patent law 18] remembers from his case-law studies Crebbers Vs. The Hoblands Guild, which upheld a similar situation, in which a mercenary was enlisted to recover an unpatented secret recipe. Because the Guilds can’t patent what they do, but they still manage to restrict who knows their methods by recourse to secret processes, recipes, and the like.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Well, yes, but according to Crebbers Vs. …. secrets are protected, even when not patented, so I’m here to discover what these two know, and then we’ll determine the appropriate course of action. I’ll have them back unharmed, and throw in a couple bottles to boot.</div>\n<div>- Dalpholph: So, Aphelia, who’s mute, stole secret recipes?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I’m saying she might be in league with this elf over there, and we’re going to have to talk to both of them.</div>\n<div>- Flick (to Aphelia): I was given to understand that Baronian was not aware of this particular emplacement. Have you led me off track, AGAIN? [Deception/Persuasion : failure]&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Dalpholph: I think discussing this makes a lot of sense; I’m not sure we’re going to allow you to take her out of here by force.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Certainly I have no desire to quarrell.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drastically increasing the danger level, Aphelia plays an intractable mindworm on the flute to troll Flick. Jean-luc slowly and unthreateningly moves closer to Dalpholph, who stars moving to meet him.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Dalpholph (in a stage whisper): Now that I think about it, you could certainly help us stand up to this elf you’re after, who really kind of trounced us.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Of course! Tepplin has very little regard for brew … stealers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Balgalaphus suddenly shoves Flick onto the ground. Falling, Flick invokes an unusual malediction (“little rascals apple dumpling gang motherfuckers”?), part of the northern Horth dialect, as Balgalaphus steps in between her and Aphelia.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Balgalaphus: What … was that? Did I hear you say apple? Is that a dig at the fact that Seomra refuses to grow apples? You must be referring to our sister tree.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick loses all sense of proportion as her butt makes contact with the ground, shouting in Abyssal, “Come now ravager of the Plains, as I unlease thee, so must thou unlease hell upon these fools”, summoning into being a Bestial Spirit named Gerd. A hole opens in reality, and out steps a miniature version of Ephatha, but quite a bit cuter. The portal opening up causes Seomra to do what looks like recoil in horror. Flick draws her rapier while Gerd chomps into Balgalaphus, who shrieks in pain. “What is this dark creature you’ve summoned?? I thought you were just a recipe stealer? What does this have to do with getting the rights to make beer?”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: I … don’t … know.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I think you all understand how serious the threat to intellectual property is, now.</div>\n<div>- Balgalaphus: I don’t understand why you would come back in here to get this woman; we had no idea if or what she’s involved in, and now you’ve created a ruckus!</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Yeah, I … just do what I’m told.</div>\n<div>- Flick: This much is clear: Our party brings the ruckus.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Balgalaphus: RUCKUS… GET OVER HERE!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>For Fez, this seems like a weird grift of the sort enacted by the pirates he spent time with in his younger days, but it’s not going very well. He gets his eyes up over the ledge, pulls a snacking ration out of his bag, and waits to see how it turns out. When reaching into the bag Fez discovers that the popcorn is incredibly wet, and the popcorn as (inversely) dry — so it takes like he’s sprinkling sand over algae. The popcorn has the size, shape, and consistency of cooked ravioli. Fez wonders if he ate some mushrooms? [Medicine 10] Something is weird. Fez knows how to salt and pack foodstuffs so they will be preserved, but something strange happened. Fez forgoes eatign it and whispers, “Hey, tree, can you take care of this,” while holding out the snacks to Seomra. Seomra takes a flower-sniff, and then retreats. A venus fly trap sticks its tongue out, spits onto the ground, and retreats back into the tree. Fez packs up the snack and puts it in his bag.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos notes at least two ruckuses and, with his superior dwarven hearing (?) has heard the conversations ‘downstairs.’&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Carlos (To Drav): Do you want to go down and check it out, or do you want to stay here by this wishing tree and eat apples?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: It sounds like we might be needed downstairs.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: OHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhkay, Drav.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos sneaks down the stairs and sits next to Fez. Offered some popcorn, he sees nothing wrong with the soppy medallions and swallows a few handfuls. It’s a little funky, but no weirder than some of the adderwort algae he used to eat after gathering it from the cave pools. However, it distinctly tastes unlike popcorn. But it’s very cheesy. “I’ve eaten worse!” said Carlos, continuing to slurp.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Gerd: Master, why are you letting the elphs attack me like this? (And it backs up into you like a dog doing the backwards hump jump)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick, only half-away that she’s the reason it’s here, doesn’t respond.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Meanwhle, Cyrowan comes down the stairs, sniffs Fez’s pack and motions for a sample. Fez points to some of the popcorn that is on the stairs; Cyrowan has already started moving towards Carlos, snatches what’s in his hands, then snuffles up the crumbs.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Aphelia plays a song on her flute. Flick and Jean-luc find themselves unable to move as they soak in the extraordinarily calming melody she’s begun to play. The Elphs are affected a little more strongly, and all but Balgalaphus and Jerephala, are affected in the same way. Gurd : “Master, was this you calming them all? They’ve stopped attacking me.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: I’m sorry I dragged you into this.</div>\n<div>- Gerd (imprinting on Flick): I’m not. I love this intimate interaction we’re able to have.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A muffled clomping of hooves is heard.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Ruckus: Ruckus is here! Was I called for? I can see that one of the nethercreatures has made its way into our sacred grove. (She fires two arrows into Gurd).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: poor creature!</div>\n<div>- Ruckus: don’t declare it a poor creature! it is evil, and whoever summons it is likewise evil.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc (stage whisper): I thought maybe we could … persuade … it to be on our side.</div>\n<div>- Ruckus: What’s this about persuasion? I love to enter into dialog.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Vengeance walks up and looks nervously at Gerd. “I’m a deliveryman and I have a delivery for Jean-Luc, the famous brewer? It says here you’re … the sheriff of Brew Town? I guess that would be you, then, holding that star?”</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Yep, that’s me! You’re a total stranger to me!.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance (handing Jean-luc a bag of dead rats): Great, well I have one large order of … ‘secret ingredient’&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc has no idea what Vengeance is doing, whether it’s a grift or a prank. Jerephala, who bears a very very passing resemblance to Lydia, makes eyes at Jean-luc, says, “Oh, my my, a sheriff, how intriguing!” as the other elphs tisk her.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: This is hardly the time, or the place.</div>\n<div>- Jerephala: Oh, very businesslike I see! That’s really something.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Yes, it says here on my clipboard: “Most powerful sheriff in all the 28 kingdoms.” I don’t know why it would say that, but … he seems like a pretty big guy.</div>\n<div>- Jerephala: A little bit of puffery never hurt anyone.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: It’s hard work being so great. Unfortunately I do have a job to do.</div>\n<div>- Jerephala: Perhaps I could convince you to return when your job is done. Or is it really that urgent in the first place?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc. Of course, the Tepplin Brewery takes this sort of thing very seriously … but it’s contingent on me getting out of here with my quarry.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>-&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[53:18]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>"}

JL doesn't see anything overtly sinister about it. there is a kind fo back alley for horse or cart traffic that connects to the roads on either sides, and a small fenced-in area in the back. to spy on it, he'd have to get up top, or view the back rooms through the houses on the other side of the back alley.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>JL: it seems like it would be a poor guest to spy now, and instead check in on Fez.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>They avoid the guardds at the front and head directly for the infirmary. the pavillion top has expanded, and more shade is being provided to those inside. there don't appear to be more patients than there were before.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>They see Odeshka but not Vaka. Fez has been moved to the other side; they're keeping open beds closer to the entrance. he's on a cot with an umbrella, a washcloth across his forehead, loose blankets and just in his underclothes.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Flick and vengeance [nat 1 perception] thinks his cheeks are raging with fire. Even the little vengeance knows about monastic healing tells him that Fez is probably fine.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Flick: omg, has anyone looked in on him at all?</div>\n<div>Odeshka: our generosu donors, how are you doing today. have you come to check on yoru friend?</div>\n<div>Flick WHAT DID WE GIVE YOU</div>\n<div>JL: i gave them five gold</div>\n<div>Flick: Fez looks like he's barely going to live through the night, what's going on with him.</div>\n<div>Odeshka: no, he's been recovering miraculously. Vaka said it wasn't the marsh sickness. he's been resting and barely talking in his sleep. follow me.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>close up flick can see that he's not sweating, there's no pallor, and he's not exuding a fisih aura. every other person has dried herbs hung up around him, but they haven't had to around Fez</div>\n<div>Odeshka: he's here as an unusual patient. we give him the same level of care, but he'll recover much quicker. we don't have to fight against continual decomp. Vaka told me that the departure of his patron deity is doing the most ot hurt him. almost like his life's purpose has gone out of him, but the body is healthy.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>this is the first time Flick has heard of Fez being involved with the divine.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Odeshka: i assume you'll have to take him back to the Newemp Shire, which may be what he needs to fully recover. or a temple of his patron deity as when he was still in the colors of a paladin.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>JL notices that Odeshka's canines are noticeably longer than a humanoid. [nat 1 survival] JL identifies her as a sun vampire. (DM clarification: not all vampires are evil, it's a legit species). It's certainly the tannest vampire , and also has that victorian clothing look with the skirt.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>JL remembers seeing that child's face in the window of the temple yesterday.

this temple here extends at least its length again into the ground.</div>\n<div>flick: are you here to take your country back</div>\n<div>fles: that is impossible, for econolgical and religious reasons. but this is still a center of much power for us, so we maintain it that way, and when we can help the locals, we do so.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>[flick calc 21] - she's telling the truth about what she said.</div>\n<div>fles: the temple is considered a bit of a curiosity ehre, and we encourage that interpretation.</div>\n<div>flick: we're glad our friend is doing well, and we have an appointment to keep. we'll bid you a fond farewell.</div>\n<div>vengeance: one last thing. i wonder if our friend could use a quick prayer to arogya.</div>\n<div>vaka: are you suggested his new patron should be arogya?</div>\n<div>vengeance: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. yes.</div>\n<div>vaka: i've never heard of such a thing.</div>\n<div>vengeance: he told me if i was ever incapacitated i could make decisions for him.</div>\n<div>flick: no he didn't.</div>\n<div>vaka: i assume you can discuss that amongst you. it wouldn't be too late to just ask him when he recovers fully. but i don't know that it's been done before. a halfling -- who isn't more trustworthy than a little halfling to be an ambassador. there's i would hope no need to say this, but you won't speak poorly of us to the town, and we will make sure your friend recovers fully.</div>\n<div>vengeance: normally i trust all snakes and serpents.</div>\n<div>vaka: please don't call us snakes</div>\n<div>vengeance: there's something about this whole situation that doesn't seem right</div>\n<div>vaka: and from what i've heard from the nurses, noone thinks you seem right, so a sort of equilibrium has been attained</div>\n<div>vengeance: it takes one to know one</div>\n<div>vaka: that's pretty redundant to what i said</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>flick: we're not here to break him out of prison</div>\n<div>vengeance: i was hoping to use my hawk-hatchet</div>\n<div>[for a moment, the conjunction of the idea of kashtari, teh god of the forge, and that with the idea of forging individualized magic weapons, occurs to you, but then disappears]</div>\n<div>vengeance: darn. you know ... when ...</div>\n<div>flick: it'll come back to you.</div>\n<div>vengeance: fine, if you just want to sleep and die!</div>\n<div>vengeance sinks down next to fez's cot and clasps his hands in his. dont worry little bud, we're going to get you out of here.</div>\n<div>[religion check] as vengeance is grasping fez's hands, suddenly a brilliant voice and apiercing white light appears.

She might want to take him to town; Jean-Luc would love to visit a city in order to feel a soft pillow once again. What if we tell the rest of the party to make for the peak, and we'll be back as soon as we can. For now we're taking a skeleton crew to see if Fez can be saved. And Flick will confer with Startrella. \"Would it be possible to dial this starmote of yours to your specific location?\"</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brand: Destination</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Startrella: I don't know if I can spontaneously teleport someone to me?</li>\n<li>Flick: Well I'd be one the one casting teleportation circle.

Flick, still feeling quite nauseated, makes sure to keep her distance from Fez. Flick doesn't have any reason to distrust Fez, but Cyrowan is all over him like a cheap suit, so is brooding and waiting for when Jean-Luc and she can be at least fifteen feet away.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ratfolk</span></h3>\n<p>Flick detects some rustling over near some scrub and bare trees. She sees two humanoids the size of Fez, with rodentlike faces. They have dark-brown hair, cute rounded ears and reddish-green eyes. (Fez is uniquely abled when it comes to shades of blue, which allow him to differentiate between areas of water. - Although lately within the last few days he's found himself less able to distinguish between shades of blue, ever since emerging from under the Xanthuc Temples. Fez assumes the sky has just changed; it's the same feeling you get when you come up from under decks.) Flick is sure that these are ratfolk. There are two of them looking towards the space where another must be. She starts to make a slow arc around the rest of the scrub.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, unalerted to the danger by Flick, who's just wandered around sneakily, continues to hang out. Fez continues to try to determine why his companions smell so bad, and tries to come up with the friendliest way to tell them (they probably already know). Cyrowan is always sticking his finger into himself and smelling it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyrowan: Master Fez, there are quite a few herbs around here from which we could create a rub or poltice in order to witigate some of the odor coming from you. I've been getting some complains from Joan and her sensitive lizard nose.</li>\n<li>Fez: You've clearly mismanaged some of your pronouns there, but if you need to collect some herbs to mitigate the stink then you're welcome to.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Well thank you for your permission, sir. (And moves off into the clump of trees to the north).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick has circled around without seeing any more ratfolk. She makes a beeline over to Fez and Jean-Luc when Cyrowan disappears. \"I don't think your squire's entirely on the level.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Yes, he does have a bit of a limp. I assume it's some sort of problem for which he needs orthopedic inserts. Folk of his constitutional frailty often do.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: I mean this in the nicest possible way. You're not that great, and anyone that eager to serve has an agenda.</li>\n<li>Fez: Flick, are you going to take that?</li>\n<li>Flick: He's not wrong, Fez.</li>\n<li>Fez: Am I out of touch? No, it is my companions who are wrong. I don't think that he's eager to serve -- he's eager to <em>learn</em>. I may not be <em>the</em> greatest, but I am <em>a</em> greatest. I'm an A+ the greatest.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: your relative greatness is not the issue here. He doesn't smell great and I mean that in both senses of the word.</li>\n<li>Fez: I have noticed the smell, and I didn't want to bring this up, but I believe some of it may have rubbed off on you.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: well we were in a saddlebag together.</li>\n<li>Flick: Have you really not noticed, Fez, that since he's been along with us, the inner light that shines out and gives you your power has started dimming, almost like you've been forsaken or laid aside.</li>\n<li>Fez: But as the tide ebbs and flows, so do all things in life.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: just for a second, is it not possible that what we're saying has merit.</li>\n<li>Fez: Oh it's certainly possible, but I think it's less likely since we're not saying it.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: can we proceed for a moment as though we're right, and, if we aren't we'll happily eat crow.</li>\n<li>Fez: Everyone needs a time to shine, so I will let you explore your failures as a learning experience; so too my squire is learning to explore his own failures.</li>\n<li>Flick: that's great, we'll take it.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fez is, meta-speak, feeling under a single level of exhaustion. Pass Without Trace, shrouding them in a veil of silence, mutes the only conversational tone of the discussion. (Fez is at a \"everybody needs to hear this\" voice.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">... and Vengeance</span></h3>\n<p>At this moment, Vengeance (daydreaming about being passed out drunk in Stato's Den), shouting \"Wait for me!\", walks sloppily up to them with Mule by his side. Simultaneously, Cyrowan, being held at knifepoint, is pushed out of the brush by a \"human\". Flick whispers : \"this human doesn't know how little of a bargaining chip he has.\" Fez, \"Right on cue, a squire learning of failures.\" Jean-Luc, \"Certainly if he's a decent squire he can get himself out of that scrape.\"</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cyrowan Captured in a Sacred Grove</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jiffutch: Has your squire here been misplaced?</li>\n<li>Fez: Yes, he's been mis-placed, among many other misses</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: He was intruding upon sacred plants in our grove, and that will not be tolerated. We are protectors of this forest here.</li>\n<li>Fez: I'm quite sorry; were the plants clearly marked as sacred with appropriate signage?</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: From what realm do you hail that signage is required to recognize a sacred area?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All Flick can tell is that he's humanoid; he's dressed more like an adventurer: he has on leather armor, a tunic, leather gloves, and tight-fitting pants. He doesn't have any gear on him. \"Probably from some brigand's camp,\" thinks Flick.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: No, most civilized areas <em>do</em> mark their sacred sites. Cities, Hobbittons, pretty much the whole thing is covered in signage.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: It does help in avoiding these kinds of misunderstandings.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Did you say he was 'traipsing'? That doesn't really sound like him: he's not a traipser.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Yes, I was being generous there. He was mincing and squating in very undecorous ways. Ugly is another way of putting the manner in which he was moving around the area.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Lord Fez, don't worry, I'll protect you from the sharp pointy end of this man's rapier.</li>\n<li>Fez: Yes, young squire, you're doing fantastic.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Luckily he's got it at the base of my spine. But I can see how for Lord Fez everything seems to be \"the neck\" insofar as it's above your eye-line.</li>\n<li>Fez: Well, druid? If you could please move your knife away from the behind of my squire, about a foot forward or so.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: You claim responsibility for this wet musty man?</li>\n<li>Fez: In some ways, yes.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Note I didn't say 'lusty'. I hope you didn't mishear that.</li>\n<li>Fez: I diiiiid, and I'm quite confused.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: I can't attest to his lustiness, only the way in which he smells of mildew, although, it doesn't appear to emanate from him, but one he has spent much time around.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fez looks knowingly at Flick, and then Jean-Luc. \"This is what I was talking about before!\" \"This is what we get for not being in places with showers,\" replies Jean-Luc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Anyway, he means you no harm. He was merely looking for plants to \"quench his stench\" as they say.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At that, Cyrowan attempts to make a break for Fez and slips on some wet grass, going face-first into the ground.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Thank you for prostrating yourself, as is required of a squire.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Truly I have no quarrel with him as a person, but he's invaded our sacred realm, and restitution must be made. [Prf-n.20] Your methods for commanding obeisance from your servants baffles me, but if this is how you do it, so be it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jiffutch takes a step back and prods Cyrowan forward with his sword. Flick adopts <em>b&uacute;inn</em> [^b&uacute;inn], \"Look you put me in a funny position because I'm kindof on Team Nobody here, but what I don't like is the idea of having to give you something just because you said these trees and shit belong to you. So how about our restitution is that you fuck right off and we go back to going about our business.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jiffutch: Did you say, Team Nobodaddy? One of the Great Gods of the Blay Kessons?</li>\n<li>Flick: Nope.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Well, you also told me to fuck off, and I will not do that, this is our Sacred Grove back here, and you should be the ones to fuck off.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: Uh - whoever does the fucking off, and either is fine with me, I think it's good if we go our separate ways.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: If you're able to wrangle your rangy friend here &hellip;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick turns back to Jean-Luc and Fez, \"Are we 100% sure we shouldn't just give him to them?\" Fez, \"Of course not. And please don't kill this poor man.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: I have no desire to hang around this odorful young man.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc (whispers): we <em>have</em> killed people for less offense.</p>\n<p>[Jean-Luc n.20] Remembers Jiffutch from Cressida. There were a few posters; they never met in person. He's another assassin; one of them viewed themselves in competition. There were a certain number of rumors that circulated about him: he could change form, or hide in the sewers capably (could disappear into the sewers). He killed the Archduke Belsavius when they were visiting Cressida; the Archduke holds their court in a different area of the country.</p>\n<p>Jiffutch is not stepping forward into the grove; he's either trying to avoid getting involved &hellip; he probably doesn't want to pursue this any further than he has to. (The Pumpkin Prince is a persona that Jean-Luc had adopted to infiltrate royal courts; you heard it here first, folks). Jiffutch does not recognize Jean-Luc, who keeps the information to himself for the moment. \"It's in our mutual interest if we go our separate ways.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: \"Yes, I think that's the best choice here. Even tho there's no signage\" and he throws a look at Fez, \"the grove is clearly adumbrated by the well-delineated difference between heavy forest and low grass. Make sure you ignore this weird little winding curve of the path close to myself, and be on your way!\"</p>\n<p>He attempts to blend into the forest, interrupted by Jean-Luc's question, \"We are quite a long way from Cressida. What brings you out here?\" Jiffutch, \"As I've said, I'm one of a group of forresting men who protect these trees from intruders. I -- we --- we're still attempting to grapple with the notions of pure democracy and communalism, so my pronouns may slip from time to time, but have no doubts that I have no connection with any urbanites.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"I think the Archduke would beg to differ.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: \"The Archduke. bastard if I ever &hellip; heard of a title. None of us need Archdukes, let alone masters, or lords, or vassals.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: \"No argument here. Why don't you drop the act, and tell us what you're doing out here.\" Flick goes to double the intimidation, but Jean-Luc gives her the \"tone it down\" sign. Immediately, his clothes shift and warble, and he grows in bulk to the point where his legs are little protrusions, and his body is a thick column of hairy muscle. His hands turn into claws and his face elongates. He's a ratman. a were-rat. \"You want me to drop the act, fine. But your charge gets it.\"</p>\n<p>Flick turns and looks south to where she saw the other ratfolk, and hears them rustling after Jiffutch calls out.</p>\n<p>[Initiative]</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Vengeance has been picking the sacred plants and creating a tiara for himself, crating it into a mitre and subconsciously emulating the wardrobe of the Archbishop which, for a monk, would typically be considered blasphemous. (The tiara mafia!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM apologizes for missing that Galen said Vengeance was picking the sacred plants here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Look at me, I'm the Pope, what a fool I am! In my stupid hat!\"</li>\n<li>\"Don't you mean the Archbishop?\" Vengeance considers this journey with himself.</li>\n<li>Yes, the Archbishop -- more like the Arch Buffoon!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick wonders at Vengeance's ability to always be in 'his own encounter' despite the success of his attacks. Fez remembers tales of 4-dimensional being told to him while playing checkers, and wonders if this is what Vengeance is engaged in. Mule looks upset but reins it in and controls herself, but it seems like she's somewhat sensitive to the herbs chosen. Vengeance knows exactly what she's allergic to, which is seafood and carrots after conducting an allergy test with rusty bits of metal. Vengeance picks a few of the offending ones and puts them in his pack should Mule get out of hand later.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jiffutch rages out</span></h3>\n<p>Jiffutch attacks Cyrowan, biting him in the neck</p>\n<p>Flick: \"Gents, it does occur to me that Cyrowan might be necessary to undo what is afflicting Fez, it occurs to me the possibility that it's not his mere presence but a curse or geas [^geas].\" \"I don't like being ordered around by this asshole, so I'll save Cyrowan just to spite him,\" adds jean-Luc. \"I like it! and I'll take care of these fuckers in the bushes back here,\" says Flick.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, unexpectedly hardy, is simultaneously bitten and stabbed. Little spouts of poison, coating the sword, overflow from Cyrowan's wounds. \"Master Fez, this feels like something Vengeance might do to himself while we're not watching. I think the faster you can get over here so I can learn from you, the better.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: You seem to be learning quite well yourself but I will come aid you as requested.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick sends her \"extra-planar probe\" to sharpshoot one of the rustling shapes, sending a bolt of force damage into its mortal flesh and liquefying the organs, the pressure forcing the roiling contents explosively out of the ruptured skin.</p>\n<p>\"Cease! Cease!\" they hear from one of the surviving ratfolk. \"Stay where you are and it won't happen again,\" Flick says, slinking to an advantageous angle on Jiffutch's position. Still in a bloodlust, the musthrope puts his foot on Cyrowan's neck, turns around to look at you, and sheaths his sword, shouting, \"Leave! Leave those folk alone. Do not implicate them in the horrific attacks you clearly wish to direct against me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't you start this?\" Fez asks. \"I did!\" he replies, \"but I had no idea how much power skulked within your wan and unmighty human bodies.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: We're not human!--</li>\n<li>Flick: Fuck around and find out, buddy</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Yes, the full truth of that ultimatum is becoming apparent to me. I truly have never before had to concern myself with a beleagured retinue of dispossessed who, in their time of need, name me leader. It truly is devastating, to witness the death of one's liegerat [^liegerat].</li>\n<li>Flick: So will you take us up on that final offer?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jiffutch helps Cyrowan to his feet: \"Here's your foul-smelling friend, although with my olfactory bulbs, I'm able to determine that the smell does not originate from him but rather the halfling here.\" He points clearly to Fez, who assumes him to be pointing at the third ratfolk.</p>\n<p>Fez rather pedantically and tiresomely inquires as to the ethical system which would allow one to attack those thought weaker than oneself, but the moment they are proven stronger, that person then desires peace. \"Kind of a shit-bird move, rat-man,\" Flick summarizes in her typical David Milchean way.</p>\n<p>\"It's not that you were weaker; my bloodlust got the best of me; and, as I've said, I'm not used to caring for those who can be shattered into pointilistic droplets of blood by the steady concentration of an archer. I truly &hellip; do not know how to deal with this, psychologically, \" and he shrinks into his human form. The two rats in the grove continue weeping and looking towards one another in shock and disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"I kind of feel bad,\" Flick says. \"I don't!\" Jean-Luc responds.</p>\n<p>Now that Cyrowan has been helped to his feet, he moves to Fez. \"Sir, you were able to come to my aid so effectively. Allow me to once more pledge my undying servitude, and my desire to learn at your feet all the martial arts of swordplay and courtly graces and techniques of persuasion which ultimately woo to your side those who may wish to antagonize you but ultimately prove susceptible to your noble wits.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your desire to serve is once again well-received, young one, and perhaps one day you will be as great as I am.\"</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, sir, but I'm going to &hellip; I think I left something back here.\" Cyrowan shuffles backwards out of the range of Fez's smell, motioning to Vengeance for some kind of sage smoke smudge or perfumy herb.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to have to speak about your regiment indeed,\" replies Fez. Vengeance walks over and wraps some of the sage around his neck and lights it up. \"Hieronymous, you truly are a kind companion. I don't know why you're persisting in this strange and unsolicited practice, but I will consent,\" says Cyrowan, breathing deeply of the smoke. Vengeance smells the fishy odor wafting from Fez.</p>\n<p>Flick comes over to inspect Cyrowan, but finds it incredibly difficult to concentrate on him long enough to conduct an inspection. The bite is severe, and already beginning to fester; but he has no idea if the musthropy [^musthropy] is confounding the diagnosis. Leaning into her strenghts, Flick wheels around to Jiffitch, \"Tell me what you did to him!\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch approaches: \"I regret to tell you, your squire here has been infected with myranthropy. Vengeance, stomachic [^stomachic] he was guilted into using up some of your best smudgesage, has his mind elsewhere, but Flick and Jean-Luc notice that Jiffutch is trying to catch their eye and avoid Cyrowan's. \"Why don't you and Cyrowan get going down the road, Fez,\" Flick says. \"An excellent idea; I have many things to teach him about an encounter, such as Never To Put One's Back To A Sword. Come, Cyrowan!\" says Fez. \"Master, you know it wasn't my fault! My back was to the sky while I was bent over collecting herbs. If I must treat the sky as a sword, then truly I don't know what to do, but these are lessons I must learn.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must always be wary of The Skyward Sword; let me tell you of its greatness.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please do, this is exactly what I came for!\" and he walks away with Fez, the latter pontificating incoherently on fighting stances.</p>\n<p>Fez and Cyrowan walk by the two rats near the grove cutting back the bits of shrub on which pieces of their exploded friends still rest. Fez hears one of them say something along the lines of \"Return to the mother\" or \"give to the mother\" and \"won't be a total waste\" but they nevertheless look emotionally devastated, and this clearly isn't any sort of opportunity for them. Fez remarks to Cyrowan, \"this is one of the problems with the primitive religions.\" To which Cyrowan responds, \"What makes them primitive for you, sir?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it's readily apparent &hellip; they talk about worshipping. How do I say this? It's a matriarchal type of worship. Most religions have moved onto the more correct patritheism,\" says Fez.</p>\n<p>\"Very good, sir. What about a kind of non-binary theology?\" asks Cyrowan.</p>\n<p>\"That's a slightly more post-modern concept. I don't know if it'll ever catch on,\" replies Fez.</p>\n<p>\"What about serpent-sexual? Maybe even squid-sexual?\" asks Cyrowan.</p>\n<p>\"My knowledge of that is a little inky,\" puns Fez.</p>\n<p>Vengeance says, \"I'm sorry about your friend there. That was a real doozy. Did he have a wife and kids, that kind of thing?\"</p>\n<p>[1:27] \"Ripper had a few friends, nobody in her domestic circle, sadly, but I know she will be missed,\" answers a rat introducing herself as Catchkey.</p>\n<p>\"Probably a pillar of the community,\" says Vengeance.</p>\n<p>\"Well, as far as pillars, I know that Jiffutch has cautioned us from setting ourselves up on pedestals. In a way we're all supposed to be role models, but also followers,\" says Catchkey, believer in Rat-ical Democ-Rat-ic ideals.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"As usual, the people we exploded end up being pretty cool dudes.\"</p>\n<p>Catchkey, \"I'm only cool because my tears are helping to quench my hot rage, a rage I may not exact upon you, which, I'm told, is the best way. If only another here understood that emotions are better suppressed than acted upon, I wouldn't feel so alone.\"</p>\n<p>Febba, the more robust of the two, looks around, but no one meets her eyes.</p>\n<p>Flick comes up beside Jiffutch, \"what did you really want to say about Cyrowan.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch attempts a whisper. \"What do you know about this squire of yours? I've never seen a reaction to a bite, in a humanoid, quite like his.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"You don't need all the details, but he's super hinky. As a matter of fact, we're headed to Sandford <em>kind of</em> hoping to get him out of our hair? It's a work in progress. In fact, the only reason we didn't let you have your way with him is because it's possible we might need him to undo whatever fish curse has befallen our sacred warrior.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"And also I don't like you.\" Jiffutch, \"What's that there?\" Jean-Luc, \"nothing, we'll talk later.\" Jiffutch, \"Do I spy a fellow rogue?\" Jean-Luc, \"We've run in the same circles before.\" Jiffutch, \"Doubtless, I'm faster, as I can adopt a four-legged gait. Is this what you imply?\" Jean-Luc, \"Maybe, metaphorically we ran in the same circles. I was in Cressida when you assassinated the Archduke. Beat me to it, as it were.\" Jiffutch, \"Then I must appear as no less than an idol to you. Speaking of stepping on pedestals; I know I tell the smaller folk that it's something we can leave behind, but I'm glad it keeps those like us on our toes, am I right?\" Jean-Luc, \"Sure -- back to our problem with our squire 'friend'\" Jiffutch, \"Yes, now that I have revealed myself as a shapechanger, particularly of the rodentia, I can admit I spend a great deal of time in the sewers, I've met my share of huge &hellip; turtles of a juvenile age, which have mutated into large crime-fighting forms, Turtle Power, but what I wish to impart to you is that your once-paladin's squire is under the rule of some kind of icky, underwater deity. There's a feeling of &hellip; I don't know if you could tell,\" looking at Flick, \"but the wound exhibited almost a protective sludge that it exuded, against my bite, and very few know the bite of a lycanthrope or muranthrope takes effect, but I was able to see that it would not, and it's perhaps because this creature is not suceptible to that sort of magic.\" Flick, \"Are you implying that he's not even humanoid? Or that he's just been -- or that he's in thrall to some kind of pescid deity?\" Jiffutch, \"I think it's affected his physical makeup, if ever he was fully humanoid: it could be that that's merely an adopted hybrid form.\" Flick, \"This is in alignment with our gathering suspicions. So he's not actually going to turn into a were-rat, is he?\" Jiffutch, \"I don't believe so, no. But given the power of his pledge, he may acquire some of the more pernicious features, but I don't believe that fully inhabiting the body of a giant rat will ever be available to him, no.\" Flick, \"One more reason to put him down, amirite, J-L?\" Jean-Luc, \"As if we needed one.\" Flick, \"Well, not being aware of your history together, I can't help but think this meeting is slightly awkward; thanks for the help you've given us &hellip;\" Jiffutch, \"I myself am against capital punishment, so please take that into consideration when dealing with this creature.\" Jean-Luc: \"I would prefer to take my morality lessons from literally anybody else.\" Jiffutch: \"Yes, we should make up our own minds while keeping in front of us the precepts and morals which have been passed down by those who make it their profession to outline the tenants of such beliefs.\" Jiffutch: \"Catch you on the flipside --\"</p>\n<p>Flick: \"--------------------------------Dudemeisters!\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance: \"bee tee dubs, have you ever been to a place called Redwall, in Mossflower?\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch begins to daydream and pontificate, \"Oh the beautiful red &hellip; stone&hellip; walls of Redwall, in their &hellip; carved &hellip; stone &hellip; shapes!\" as he retreats back into the grove. Vengeance can tell he has no idea what he's talking about.</p>\n<p>Catchkey and the other have placed the straw into bundles and move to catch up with Jiffutch.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"There were always rumors that Jiffutch used the sewers to move so quickly about the city, but I have no idea what he's doing here.\" Jean-Luc has no idea if this is an act or part of a job, if he's ingratiating himself to the rat people as part of a job, or if he really did find some sort of inner peace. It's probably not the inner peace one, though. I have to believe that, whatever nefarious plans he may have, they do not involve us.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"The fact that a court assassin from Cressida is in this neck of the woods tells us that whatever settlement we show up at is going to be kindof a shit show.\" Jean-Luc, \"Yes, it usually is.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[bathroom break]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick, \"It was weird how quickly they panicked, too, but that might have been a sincere reaction.\" Fez, even at his distance, smells a rat. \"It is concerning that he seemed to care about it,\" says Jean-Luc. \"He obviously needs them for some reason,\" suggests Fez. \"If you want to be cynical about it, he clearly felt he couldn't lose any more of them.\" says Flick. \"Or,\" says Jean-Luc,\" he was using it to disguise his own self-preservation.\"</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Burrowlings</span></h3>\n<p>The group proceeds south-east a couple miles, only to hear a high-pitched whining cry, sounded pained and distressed, coming from off to the right. A humanoid animal. Flick, \"God, no more werecreatures!\" \"A little too high-pitched to be just an animal\" says Jean-Luc, \"I've never claimed to be the most moral person, but i don't want innocent things to suffer horribly.\" Jean-Luc draws his sword in case it's a trap. They see a creature about 70 feet away, in deep brush and lake weeds. The small creature is light brown and furred; it reminds them of a large prairie-dog. It looks like it would walk on two legs. It's wearing a bicep bracelet and a little satchel. It is bent over double and appears to be weeping.</p>\n<p>Flick starts traipsing through the brush and calls out \"oh fellow traveller, we mean you no harm,\"</p>\n<p>Nem, \"Who's there, who's talking? What do you want?\" Flick, \"Only to see what troubles you.\" Jean-Luc, \"We heard your cries from the road.\"</p>\n<p>This creature's eyes were clouded with tears, and when she looked up she couldn't see anything, \"I don't know if you can help&hellip;\"</p>\n<p>Flick, closing the distance, can see that there is a body in front of this creature, over which they are bowed. The cause of death cannot be determined. There is no blood, and they appear to be wearing as few clothes as the other.</p>\n<p>Vengeance recognizes these creatures from around the monastery. They were notorious for undermining the foundations by digging extensive tunnels. He even recognizes this sort of cry; if one of the burrowlings would become isolated from the rest of the pack and be unable to find its way back. The call could attract the pack, who would rescue them.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Oh my god, guys, I hate these fucking things. You don't know how many of them I had to hit over the head ; the problem is, you hit one, and another just pops up in their place. They're disgusting. I hate them.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"That reminds me of a childhood game we used to play, whack-a-gnoll.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"Ironically, since gnolls are not burrowing creatures.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"Yeah, it was real messed up and racist\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"It sounds like you were assassinating them.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"I'm not proud of it, ok. It was a different time, then.\"</p>\n<p>As Vengeance and Fez recount the ways in which they would kill humanoids, \"I can't find the rest of our burrow; I can't drag my friend back there and also find my way. Perhaps you can help?\" says the burrowling.</p>\n<p>Flick and Jean-Luc's knowledge of the creatures is simlar to Vengeance's. Since they aren't as tied to the preservation of large stone buildings, they don't care if the ground has holes. Perhaps Jean-Luc knows of some who were taken in by the ratfolk in the cities almost like orphans or refugees, and used as scouts. They feel comfortable under the ground or living in the interstitial parts of houses. For the most part though you would know them as farmers who brought goods into the city to sell, or, for Flick, as farmers. Flick's parents would complain about burrowlings whose holes would cause the occasional broken ankle for a farmhand, but wouldn't pose a danger to the crops.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"First of all, I'm sorry for your loss, no one deserves to go through that. How did your companion meet their sad fate?\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"We were just at the water to refresh ourselves, and it'd been a long journey here, but then she was grabbed by some kind of creature, and all I could do was bring her back out, and I couldn't resuscitate her.\"</p>\n<p>Flick moves away from the bank, and activates her Primeval Awareness for Monstrosities and Fiends (her favored enemies). Flick doesn't detect either of those within (5) miles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Which may not be entirely accurate at the greater limits &hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance, \"What did this creature look like?\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"It was mostly under water; it didn't really poke its head out.

We're sorry for your loss. He's not used to life outside the monastery.\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"Oh, he lives in a monastery? I guess I can relate to that &hellip; the burrow at times can feel kind of constraining.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"No. I never felt constrained\"</p>\n<p>Nem: What was your experience there like?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Whatever it was, it was completely the opposite of yours, ok. WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS. Let me just nip this in the bud.</p>\n<p>Nem: We certainly have far different levels of hair coverage over our bodies.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: You haven't even complimented my hat.</p>\n<p>Nem: Oh, is that a hat? I thought it was a strange growth.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Oh, that's a benign cyst.</p>\n<p>Nem: Which side is the hat on?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It's cocked &hellip; rakishly &hellip; to the right? Am I still talking to you?</p>\n<p>Nem: Yes. do you wish to?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: No, I'm done here. Why are we talking to this beast. Does anybody care about this?</p>\n<p>Flick: It's no beast, Vengeance. We're rendering the same aid we would expect from any other honest traveller on the road.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: And let's be honest, we do our share of harm in the world; this feels only right that we try to put some aid out as well.</p>\n<p>Flick: If you're not wearing a tiara you have nothing to fear from us.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Well I'm not the one who exploded somebody with an arrow; my record is clean and I don't need to do any sort of penance here. You can do your good deeds, and I'm gonna be on my way.</p>\n<p>Flick: He's not wrong.</p>\n<p>Nem: It's so good to know that a community of adventurers still wears its heart on its sleeve. That everything it feels is easily &hellip; descried. I might even say &hellip; it's perfect &hellip; for this &hellip; moment.</p>\n<p>Flick draws her bow. She suddenly grows goosepimples and for the first time experiences horripilation, and goes to retreat about thirty more feet until she recognizes an eerie feeling fetting [^fetting] from that direction.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc sees the burrowling that was dead leaps up, Alive! \"The Samaritan Snare is what we call it in the trade.\" Flick turns, and for a moment experiences an alternate timeline of her life in which she fell into madness upon hearing otherworldly slurps and whispers from the back room of a tavern. This creature is a grotesque, spaghettilike, blue fleshcone, inset with hundreds of piercing red eyes, on top of pink fleshy spider legs -- the Lovecraftian version of the Lunar Lander.</p>\n<p>Fez, \"Is it called Putreosity or something.\"</p>\n<p>Gorf: the name is SOULEATER or GORF as I'm known by my friends.</p>\n<p>Fez, \"I guess you'll be Souleater to us, then.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The DM would like to indicate that yes, he is friends with Gorf.]</p>\n<p>[The real monstrosity was the friends we made along the way!]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gorf blasts Flick with a black beam of crackling energy shooting from one of its eyes. \"You've let me see your soul, and I will have it!\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"Not today, flesh rover.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"Just another weird monster that wants souls!\" The burrowling (Nem) he'd just spoken to smiles confidently and runs towards Jean-Luc. It bits into Jean-Luc's leg, but he manages to rattle its noggin with a good kick such that it can't get its claws into him.</p>\n<p>\"Submit to Gorf and this will all be over!\" screams Nem.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"I've been &hellip; I have better offers on the table.\"</p>\n<p>Nem, \"But this offer is so close and convenient. -- so be it. \"</p>\n<p>Vengeance jumps towards the burrowlings and fiddles with some oil and a flint to cast fireball. Jean-Luc slashes at Nem, but the agile creature manages to make out with a mere scratch.</p>\n<p>Nem: You see, the natural weapons are far stronger than those made by corrupted man!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc sees, coming out of the water, his long-lost love, Lydia, with whom he had such a terrible / uneventful breakup. Flick sees an unfamiliar woman. Jean-Luc regains 6 HP, feeling energized and replenished. 'Lydia' says to Jean-Luc, \"I have been &hellip; hiding from these evil creatures in here. I tried to drown one. If you can come over and help me out of the waters, that I know that we can defeat them together and return to the city.\" Part of Jean-Luc knows that there is 0 chance that the woman he met in Cressida, the daughter of a shopkeeper, has found herself in this body of water drowning a burrowling; versus a familiar face and an offer to go back to the city.</p>\n<p>Flick: 100% this is a Rusalka, guys!</p>\n<p>Fez: Could also be a changeling.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc is vaguely suspicious. As far as he can tell, it's Lydia: he can smell a perfume of hers, the alto of her voice is spot on; the grass is parting as she moves through the grass towards him. She throws scared and frightened looks at the burrowlings. Despite his vague suspicions, he says, \"Let's defeat them together.\"</p>\n<p>Lydia, \"It's so wonderful we can be together again!\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"Indeed; I've always regretted our breakup\"</p>\n<p>Lydia, \"Me too, why, can you even remind me of why -- no, nevermind, all we need is this moment right now, and our shared future.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance takes a book of matches in one hand, and oil in the other, caught in an endless process where either the matches or the oil is not in the right place at the right time. Mule has come over to lick up the applebutter oil which is what Vengeance has been using. (She's allergic to apple skins, but not applebutter made without the skins.)</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Master Vengeance, do you need assistance lightning the oil?\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Yeah -- if you could just light that match , that'd be terrific.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Sometimes the hardest thing to do is a thing you've done by yourself thousands of times.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Yes, I find that's always the case,\" and he casts fireball at Gorf. \"As a terrible person I love Ska music, but I've never been a fan of real big fish.\"</p>\n<p>Nem: Who are you talking about?</p>\n<p>Gorf gets burnt up. Some of the blue ooze comprising its upper pyramid starts to smolder, and Gorf begins to give off a pestilent aura possibly more pestilent than Fez's. The odor smells like burning play-doh. Gorf, skittering on its spider appendages, is only as fast as your typical adventurer.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Anyone up for a fish fry?\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Very good, master vengeance.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, resentful towards Fliph for the embarrassing attempt at stealing the former's name without the proper mouth anatomy (\"weird malformed burrowling tongue\"), and even more resentful that she didn't get \"advantage\" against the heavily obscured ratfolk, with Fliph not having acted, she is flatfooted.</p>\n<p>K'Fliph: Actually my name is K-Fliph; I just prefer not to pronounce it because I'm so good at it.</p>\n<p>Flick moves far to the east, at the north rim of the lake, -- \"are you a rapper?\"</p>\n<p>My signature move is to K'Fliph you off.</p>\n<p>Flick sees, as the force damage from her arrow concusses K'fliph, that her skin almost gives way to an cadaverous explosion of blood, but her tough burrowling skin retains her body's flesh, and she barely surives the blast.</p>\n<p>I think now I'm just \"phhhhhhhhhhhh\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"There are still bigger fish to fry.\" Fliph, \"Bigger FLIPH to fry?\"</p>\n<p>Flick shoots a Fizzlecyst poison arrow at Gorf, missing. She then slides her shield off her shoulder and holds it in front, but she'll have to drop it to fire her bow. Confronted with the enormity of Gorf's aberrational body; Flick finds herself unable to focus on Gorf, caught in a look unable to focus. [Wisdom save 10]. She's drawn to the moment in her past? future? where she encountered a similar type of creature, and for the moment feels herself compelled to indulge in a tic. Flick had trouble with biting her fingernails, which made drawing a bow so painful, so she'd given it up.</p>\n<p>K'Fliph, at the brink of death, decides to attack Flick. Flick keeps her clawing hands at bay with her shield, but KP bites into her legs. \"Looks like once I get under your shield I can begin tearing at your flesh.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Master, who do you wish that I should go after? Fez: Do your best to be a distraction on behalf of Jean-Luc. His fighting style is sadly inadequate while alone; if you were to interpose yourself perhaps he could attain \"average\" effectiveness. The closer Cyrowan gets to Gorf, his body begins to ripple and turn black, almost like he's experiencing spontaneous idiopathic bruising. As this happens, he concentrates on Gorph, and the ground around Gorph explodes in tentacles in a 20ft. square.</p>\n<p>Gorph, perhaps a kindred spirit to these tentacles, rides them like a wave, as its spiderlegs massage the tentacles. \"You think one of the Old Spells can damage me? You're incredibly mistaken.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan's arms and feet are plunged into the earth, and look to be rising again as the tentacles. Fez, seeing this, sees the otherwordly evil emanating from every being, and sees Mule as the closest target. Mule looks at Fez, assumes the best, and comes closer and begins to nuzzle Fez. \"Roxfalannnah noooooooo!\" screams Vengeance. Fez goes \"whole hog\" at the eldritch horror. \"Fiend!\" he shouts, showing off to Cyrowan, going for a sweep the leg / tentacles.</p>\n<p>Vengeance sees Fez clearly taunting him, skipping around Mule and slashing at her fetlocks with his whip. \"Ah, that's actually pretty hot\" declares Vengeance.</p>\n<div>[^b&uacute;inn]: A particular ready position learned by elven rangers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^geas]: (pr. gesh, gaysh, geesh)&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^liegerat]: Like a liegeman, but a ratfolk.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^musthropy]: Also <em>muranthropy</em> or <em>myranthropy</em>; were-mouse or were-rat-dom.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^stomachic]: fig.

In the early morning, Flick found herself for the first time by another elf unrequiring of nought but a daily trance. Hieronymus's&nbsp;importunate jonesing for a novel deletery<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;arrested a friendship&nbsp;in potentia&nbsp;but catalyzed a chary trance which began a battue<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;out of a nearby goblin named Bampot. After being patronized by Flick and unsatisfactorily reassured as to the group's grithfulness[^grithfulness], Bampot was first mistaken for one Feekus by Hieronymus. They soon discovered their shared identification as goinfre[^goinfre] with respect to animal and vegetal poison, and Bampot introduced Hieronymus to the practice of bakhaqalaj[^bakhaqalaj].

Joan sits cross-legged, reading out of certification tomes.</p>\n<p>Startrella: Oh, so <em>now</em> you're sharing this stuff?!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc [History not bad] knows there are some words not to call hobgoblins; (Jean-Luc is proficient in multiple slurs and curses as part of his thieves' cant). The worst one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blidge (the b word)</li>\n<li>'hobgolem' is not offensive nor inoffensive; it's a neologist (\"A Brianniel original\")</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc goes to share a drink with his \"friend\" (waffleface - very familiar (tu); frinkle - (usted)): Share a drink with me waffleface.<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: Just. Spoke. About. Drink. Udrek Teetotals. Drink. Depressant.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You're just drinking with the wrong people.<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: What makes. Wrong? Jean-Luc: If you're getting depressed when you're drinking alcohol, I think you're doing it wrong. (He takes a big gulf and offers it to Udrek.)<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: Haven't. Made. Appropriate. Friendship. Gestures.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: In my culture, the first appropriate gesture is to share a drink with someone.<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: Understandable. But. Personal. Preference. For Stimulants. … You. Have. Any?</p>\n<p>Flick thinks about her <em>goodberries-on-the-vine.</em> (Do they negate the need for food like cocaine? Experimentation is required.) Jean-Luc maay have U.S.S. (urban-style stimulants). Paros has <em>Haste</em>? Jean-Luc has a soggy vial of fizzlecoke; Cyrowan probably dripped into it at one point.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: It got a little wet, but if you want I've had worse stimulants than this fizzlecoke here.<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: You got some wet fizzlecoke? I know just the trick. I know how to dry that stuff out.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Oof. .. Yeah, what's the trick.<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: I guess you just heat it up for a while. You have to make sure you don't burn the coke. You use a dry double-boiler situation.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: So the trick is evaporation.<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: Yeah! That's it! Travelling amongst the stars you learn so much physics it can be really helpful. And it expands your minds for those times your mind is primed to expand. (She wanders over).<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Hey, Startrella, our friend Udrek doesn't want anything to bring him down this early in the morning. Would you happen to have any powders or stimulants or \"caffeinated\" substances we can give him?<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: Like i was saying, if one of you does something real nice for me, I can take one of these starmotes and pretty much turn it into anything.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Real nice? Like what?<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: I dunno -- nothing's coming to me off the top of the dome.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Like, if we helped you across the strees, or carried your grocery bags while you were trying to open a door? That kind of thing, or were you speaking in code?<br></p>\n<p>Startrella: Yeah like if you dig a hole and fill it with water and place your cloak over it that might do the trick.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: [Insight 13: if flick can create a meditative environment or pull her into the ethereal place; something to provide a sensory deprivation environment]. (Flick walks over; )</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It's not me, it's my sentient staff that likes to pet … not ogres, but … your wonderful pet. I apologize for my staff's behavior. (His feet begin scrapingi a hole in the ground.)<br></p>\n<p>Glug: Udrek isn't my pet. We grew up in the same town! This is all looking a bit fishy. (He comes over and interposes himself between Udrek and the others.) I'm not nsure what you're trying to do here. Udrek can make his own decisions. All this fudging around with his head while we're eating -- I think you should just make your way on.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc pretends to trip in order to attempt to knock the circlet off. [two nat 20s to touch and deceive] He does it so delicately that, as he tries to pull it off, he can feel that it's embedded in Gluggranok's head, under the skin and adherent to the skull. [Strength] The circlet comes loose from his skull under one adhesion point and Jean-Luc gets as finger under it and pulls up (and out). Glugg screams as a clump of scalp tears off and he goes completely catatonic.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I'm sorry, I tripped on this tree here. -- No, I'm not sorry, this is how I do things.<br></p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Master Luc, this isn't how you get the ladies. Not by being a drunk and a stumbler.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Shut up, squire, nobody asked you.<br></p>\n<p>Cyrowan: I'm Fez's squire, how dare you talk to me that way. Lord Fez, tell him!</p>\n<p>[Initiative]</p>\n<p>Udrek reaches behind his back, produces a massive chipped claymore, and swings at Jean-Luc with his non-coke-fingernailed hand. Jean-Luc is hurt. Paros, pulling out some sweet aromatic oils and a fizzlecyst tongue, casts Suggestion and imposes disadvantage, \"I [Udrek] don't remember putting that fire out yesterday… \" Udrek fails. \"Oh. Trees. At. Risk. Of Fire?\" Jean-Luc feels the kettlehelmet trembling, and Flick has a distant memory of being compelled to put out the bar fires. \"The fire is no joke!\" Yells Flick.<br></p>\n<p>Nerch climbs up onto the cart and attempts to push the boxes off the cart. \"Hee. Hooo. Heeww.\" The cart rises up into the air as if on hydraulic suspension. Three boxes fall off the back of the cart, and one cracks open. It looks like the cat bus from My Neighbor Totoro, but without a cat face. Or eyes. But it can somehow see where you are. The Cart (Carty B) reverses and attempts to slam into Flick, who jumps nimbly out of the way.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc and Drav intuit that Nerch was an urchin, and was called Nurchin as a kid to make fun of her. It's probably why she gets along with Udrek, who's being raised as an Organiborg Hobgolem.<br></p>\n<p>The rear door of the cart's bed flips up to provide cover for Nerch.<br></p>\n<p>Cyrowan: I'm here to support you, Ms Drav, as Fez is indisposed with raging fish diarrhea.<br></p>\n<p>Joan: I can't concentrate with all this gosh dang noise! (and rushes 80 ft closer to the fray and goes into a rage for various reasons -- \"I need to know about this protocol!\")<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc gives Udrek a wide berth, comes up to Gluggranok, and rips the metal circlet off his head with a sickening tearing sound. The circlet comes off the head with chunks of hair and skin attached, almost his entire scalp, and even laminae of his skull. Udrek bellows in a rage, altho the possible fire looms larger in his mind. \"Forest. Important. Friend. In Pain. Conundrum. Using algorithm. To Decide.\" Jean-Luc dashes for the treeline. Gluggranok remains passed out on the ground.<br></p>\n<p>Flick runs up a nearby tree; \"A mere wagon skin is no barrier to the power of the planes\" as she marks Nerch and sharpshoots at her, wounding her significantly with the shots. Startrella: What are those cool ripples you're making over there?<br></p>\n<p>Nerch: I tried to get them to spring for a top to this thing. Maybe I should have tried a bit harder.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: That five gold you saved isn't looking so great now, is it?<br></p>\n<p>Nerch: No, just Udrek's learning board would have covered this. He has an invisible one, but the other one's made of wood, and that would have been great. -- and she loses concentration, at which point the cart reverts to inanimation. -- Carty, no! Carty B!! I lost Carty A a while ago. Carty A's the one with the top on it. You should see Carty C, it doesn't even have wheels, it's just on runners.<br></p>\n<p>Flick envisions the headlines after a fireball: Carty B model recalled due to flammability.<br></p>\n<p>Drav expertly places a fireball over Nerch's head; Flick sees that the entire wagon catches on fire, and Nerch is engulfed in flame and dies.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Poor Nerch, we hardly knew ye.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I'm not entirely sure we're not the bad guys here. But … I'm o.k. with it.<br></p>\n<p>Flick immediately hears the sound of arrows thudding into the trees around her. Targetted by an expert archer herself this time, she is pierced by arrows.<br></p>\n<p>Rovlar: For Nerch! Nerch won't die unrevenged!<br></p>\n<p>Flick: It's AVENGED!<br></p>\n<p>Rovlar: \"Revenged\" -- it's … hobgoblin slang!?<br></p>\n<p>Carlos jumps onto Mule, who carries the dashing, sturdy cleric closer to the battle. Startrella, still in the trance, remains … in the trance.<br></p>\n<p>Vengeance: Hey, Jean-Luc, do you mind if I give that device that you're holding a whirl. I just want to see what happens if I plug in. -- Jean-Luc tosses Vengeance the circlet, and the monk takes the prongs and jams them into his \"brain\" .. or however it was placed in Gluggranok's head.<br></p>\n<p>Flick: Oh, god damnit!<br></p>\n<p>Vek: I'm not sure they know what they're doing here, but that could be very powerful domination magic in those things. -- Drav tends to agree with Vek here.<br></p>\n<p>Cyrowan: You guys really like playing around with cerebral restylings, don't you. I mean, Lord Paros has enough going on to cover for everyone. If I were under the effects of an ancient higher power, I bet you all would know about it right away, you're so clever and attuned to things.<br></p>\n<p>[Galen's computer freezes, so I throw to Carlos for healing.]<br></p>\n<p>For a minute Vengeance feels his brain get cloudy and finds thinking difficult. He briefly feels bound to protect the contents of the boxes and take them somewhere. He feels comradely feelings towards Udrek and Gluggranok and Rovlar, and a generalized compliance with a nebulous force of masters. But then it looks like it didn't adhere to his body properly; some of the metal wiring snapped, and it doesn't seem like it would work anymore. (Maybe if he'd used a fizzlecyst fixative…) \"Everyone, I think I know what's going on here: mind control. I believe I've solved the case.\"<br></p>\n<p>Carlos casts Healing Word on Jean-Luc.<br></p>\n<p>Vengeance: Take it from me, and --<br></p>\n<p>Rovlar (aka Vengeance): I adopt vengeance as my name! -- What were you saying?<br></p>\n<p>Vengeance: If I could just say to you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's a difficult life, and I don't recommend it. If I were you I would pack it in now. -- And he casts Confusion (Qi-xotic confusion) on Rovlar. Fez continues eating some wet grass.<br></p>\n<p>Vek: Fez doesn't really look like he knows what he's doing anymore. You should take care of him.<br></p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Yes - what should I do?<br></p>\n<p>Vek: SHould go back and check on him I think.<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: Poor. Nerch. Will extinguish. This fire. Later. Other fire. Now.<br></p>\n<p>Paros fires a fire bolt at the branch on which Rovlar is standing, but it falls short, adding more flames to Nerch's pyre.<br></p>\n<p>Udrek: Nother. Fire. NOoooooo.<br></p>\n<p>Joan sits down next to a tree in order to be able to punch it and maintain her rage. Jean-Luc dashes into another bunch of trees.<br></p>\n<p>Rovlar: Vengeance will visit you too! I see you making your way across the open ground.<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You know you could surrender.<br></p>\n<p>Rovlar: Why surrender when I have the tactical advantage of being higher off the ground than you?<br></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You're outnumbered.<br></p>\n<p>Vengeance: Jean-Luc, take a break here, I'm going to handle things.<br></p>\n<p>Gluggranok remains unconscious and continues to lose blood.<br></p>\n<p>Flick sharpshoots Rovlar, hitting once, and -- YOu'll never get another arrow that high! (Rovlar) -- missing -- I told you! -- at which Flick disappears into the Etherial plane, the Magician Archer and sky-walks out his movement speed to between two trees. [Perception 17]. Though never having done this before, Flick acclimates rapidly, and sees the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the distance where Aphelia and Cyrowan are, Flick sees the merging of a dark black and bright white smoke</li>\n<li>Where Drav is, Flick sees very faintly and rippling, the figure of Eldar suspended inside a massive suit of crystalline-light plate armor</li>\n<li>Startrella, sitting there, in her papasan, is trying a couple different ways of trying out the fizzlecoke in the ethereal plane</li>\n<li>Paros looks like a buffet; heaping, steaming trays of spirit food</li>\n<li>Behind Flick, reddish-gold tendrils, like smokey vines, hundreds of them emerging from the boxes on the ground, and going straight up into the sky, disappearing a hundred feet up due in part to the limited visibility of the ethereal plane. A single tendril emerges each from Udrek and Rovlar.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div>Drav dashes closer to Gluggranok intending to stabilizer her next turn. Mule, bored, makes her way down to a freestanding cabin a few hundred feet south.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Where did that elf go? It's probably because I'm so high up and she's so far down, she gave up her tactical advantage. I'm trained in the arts of battle and strategy!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Listen, Vengeance, I feel a great deal of sympathy for you, and I understand where you're coming from.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: A true warrior doesn't need sympathy.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Of course not. I only offer you understanding. And solidarity. WHen I was a child, I had a very controlling father. Perhaps you know what it's like being under control yourself by a tyrannical device or whatever it is that's controlling you. I want you to know that it's okay. When I failed my fishermans exams, my father beat me near to death, and that changed the course of my life, and I realized I didn't have to be under his control anymore. So why don't you just come down from there and we'll unhook you from that thing, and you can live your life as a free hobgoblin.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I too used to be subject to the whip. I would go out in the evenings looking for midges, those delicious little bugs, and a few times I was caught by monsters, and my parents would beat me, but I always took it as a sign that they loved me!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Oh, you love midges too?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: One of my favorite delicacies.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: What's your favorite kind?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I like the slarm … ones. Buttermidges. Blue-green midge, i like it for the taste, even tho people think it's a panacea.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: You know if you pour some fizzlecoke onto a midge and pop it in your mouth it'll explode. And my goodness, the sensation is wonderful.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Like a pop midge? Vengeance: Midge pop.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: nouns!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Well you are a very knowledgeable lady. I wish you would come down from there. I don't want to have to hurt you. You're probably an innocent person. I want to get that thing off of you, so come down.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: You want to get what off of me?</div>\n<div>Vengeanec: The mind-control device.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: You mean the way that the desire for midges controls my mind?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: It is a very powerful desire. but I'm talking about this (holds up circlet)</div>\n<div>Rovlar: WHy are you holding that?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: I just found it. … This is what you're wearing right now. We have some really great surgeons here. Jean-Luc has taken some classes, and he can take that out for you painlessly. VERY painlessly.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: No, no. I was with you talking about the midges. I was willing to make a full spread with you. But the cap -- absolutely not!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: I promise, once you come down, we'll go on a full midge hunt, fry them up, it'll be delicious.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: WHy can't we do that with the cap on. In fact, you all look like you would wear these caps well. In fact, I can extoll their virtues to you at length.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Just come down and we can talk aboutthat.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Is that blood on that cap you're holding.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: No, I just had it in my bag with some loose newt jelly.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Oh, a platter of Bertram's midges with newt jelly (and he begins drooling out of his nose as hobgoblins do).</div>\n<div>Vengeance: quick, somebody cast a freezing smell and then we can pull him down by his saliva.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Oh, i thought you were going to eat my drool as icicle treats. I've heard those are pretty taste.</div>\n<div>[Deception check for newt jelly. ] In the Ethereal Plane, Flick sees people as kind of ghostly shapes without sharp details.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Ok, so it's not blood, but I don't want to let you near my cap: this is important to me.</div>\n<div>Flick and Vengeance have an ominous feeling, perhaps that they are being watched. Flick can see blue, gem-like or gravelly twinklings on the ground below her. like stones spread out through the grass. She decides to attack Rovlar from within the Ethereal Plane into the Material Plane using force damage.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'll avenge Glug too! Even though he's pitiable and still alive.</div>\n<div>Carlos heals Gluggranok, The wound in his heal closes up with just a bit of residual bruising and looks like he's sleeping.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: What's going on over there, did you help him? I thought i was going to have to avenge him.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: We don't have a quarrel with you.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Then why did you kill Nerch!?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well, we <em>had</em> a quarrel with Nerch.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'm notn sure why you think a quarrel with her is different from one with me. Although, I suppose, if it was about midges -- she does really despise midges, and I could see how that could escalate into immolation.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Yeah, that was the reason, you're right.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: We're happy to end this without further bloodshed.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: So you'll just make your way south. Can you dispell whatever you did to Udrek?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: It'll wear off. He's basically going to sprint for a minute.</div>\n<div>Drav: I think it's for 8 hours-- Jean-Luc: Either way it'll wear off.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: WIthout Carty-B or Udrek I'm kindof defenceless here. I mean, tactically, I have an advantage, but defensively, I'm at a disadvantage.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Like I said we're not looking to hurt you.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Ok, then … go away.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc. Can't do that. [Persuasion ?]</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'll come halfway down the tree …</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Good first step.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: In exchange, will you get Udrek to come back? Or, you know what? I'd really like to see Gluggranok conscious.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc glances over at Carlos.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: What is in those boxes, anyway?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: that's a great question, Vengeanec. They are supplies that we need to get to the coast. It's probably best if you leave them alone. I think that handling them will give you a tactical disadvantage. It's wise to proceed south. You know what, don't even worry about Udrek or Glugg. Why don't you head south, I'll take care of this.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: If there's anything I hate it's a tactical disadvantage. I think I'll just take a quick peak to see what's inside.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'd really suggest you not do that.</div>\n<div>Carlos slaps Glugg awake, but his eyes don't focus and it looks like he's awake but he's dissociated from what's going on around him.</div>\n<div>Paros (has he read something on the trauma involved in separating from the hive-mind?) walks over to examine Gluggranok.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: (in the distance) the way you're taking care of yourself, master, is really going to pot. I love grass as much as the next person but you should really give it a rest.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc is remaining aware. Gluggranok's eyes refocus, and he sees that Vengeance is holding the metal cap, and he goes to grab it out of your hands.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Woh, Gluggs, this is mine now. -- and he skips out of the way. Glugg starts moaning inarticulately. -- Oh, man, this guy is going through some serious withdrawal. Startrella, do you know of anything we can do to help him? any clinics we can send him to?</div>\n<div>Startrella: This looks like … maybe he's been on too many drugs at once. Usually I say put in him a drunk tank. Wait, what's he doing now?</div>\n<div>Gluggranok has started making his way back towards the boxes. He arrives at the closest box and feverishly starts pulling out all the packing material.</div>\n<div>Flick latches onto Rovlar's shimmery ghostly form and fires onto her. [As an Unseen Attacker, Flick gets advantage on the attack.] By Rovlar's lights, he's blasted back like a fat man getting hit in the stomach by an invisible cannon ball. Flick hears his groans of pain through the Charlie Brown Adult wah-wah filter. Flick comes out of the EP and hits her with another arrow; Rovlar's dark purple blood begin to stain the tree.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: My sweet midge blood!</div>\n<div>Flick: Is this not what we're doing?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: It is unfortunate that you did that. On the other hand. .. (and he eyes getting over and drinking some blood)</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Vengeance, my midge-infused blood makes a delicious (syrup) / rock-candy!</div>\n<div>[end of session]</div>"}

They were about to meet-cute Drav and Carlos at the entranceway when an agitated and aggrieved band of five humans pushed their way past and into the building. Carlos stood by disinterestedly (almost as though he were an entirely different person than earlier that day) while the contact he had been sent to talk to, Norman Barrelchest (one of the armory’s constables) attempted to impress upon this furious group his social superiority through enigmatic gesticulations and the distinct absence of suspenders (traditionally associated, in Marshbout, with the gentry). He was nevertheless pulled in their wake back up Plumb Highway (so called because of how straight it is, aka SCBOHSIT or “skee boh sit”) to the scene of some annoyance. Carlos dolly-zoomed in on a medical supply cabinet at the end of the infirmary as his kleptomania took hold. After some hijinks, Joan was able to thrust herself in the mix and come up with some much-vaunted suppositories and also a minor potion of healing (2d4+4 hp, 1 action), which she delivered forthwith to Carlos.</p>\n<p>Flick, too, took full advantage of this opportunity to secure the attention of Darlyle (looking a bit overworked) and Rik Sandstone (looking a bit overdressed), the two medics. They were able to do what Carlos, in his infinite sadness, had been unable to accomplish; -- namely, point Flick to Lupenna’s likely whereabouts in the visinage of Castle Karn on the Grey Tongue. Flick was not slow to point out Carlos’s relative inadequacy, thus igniting the powerful cleric’s deep-seated rage and commencing what would surely become one of the great rivalries the continent, nay, the world! had ever known.</p>\n<p>Despite this newly minted drama, the four began the five-mile trek to the Tongue. With confidence at its peak, they were enjoying the plush tranquility of Thubutter Farest when they were set upon by three plant-dogs affected by an inky evil seeping out of their eye sockets. The dogs, begging to be 'weeded', 'lawn'ched themselves at the travellers. Though the dogs were handily dispatched (all of whom exploded into clouds of ash upon death), Carlos was injured and laid flat during the fight. He was taken by a brief fit during which he suffered an ominous vision of a tunnel deep within the earth and a shapeless void moving towards him. However, perceiving that Carlos was not dead, Flick loudly boasted about her martial superiority, and the adventurers considered their options.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a64ce9c3-7fff-af0f-2c01-963af6e9169f\"></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"purdieirademacher\"><strong>— Purdie I.

I’ve only recently learned how beautiful this particular world is. Most of my time is spent amongst the stars in outer space. I have seen other planets.</div>\n<div>- Flick: I can sent gaps in the fabric of spacetime that sent us away; do you sense any circles or portals to our southeast?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: I haven’t yet been in that area. Unless these star motes have gotten the feel of a place, the areas are pretty murky for me. I have teleport circles back on my home worlds that I can use, but here it’s pretty foggy.</div>\n<div>- [**] Flick reminds herself to listen out for anyone boasting of that kind of knowledge. The starmote dimms as she returns it to her bag of holding. Frustrated at her inability to skip all the boring walking —</div>\n<div>- Star: Flick, you have to remember to stay calm in the face of frustration. It does no good to get exasperated at small obstructions (obstructlettes). And … won’t the journey itself be pleasant and enjoyable?</div>\n<div>- Flick: No, and maybe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: It’s your wise and insightful mind that can analyze these small distinctions.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Joan takes any spare moments to pore through arcane tomes and archaeological texts. Even though she was overburdened with her new certifications, it doesn’t do her any good in the real world; now she’s pursuing learning for its own sake. Flick commiserates outloud with this unspoken assertion.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Traveling west, the group skirts the north shore of Laviré Lake. They leave behind them the smaller of the Goads, Mess, and turn their eyes to a strange island in the lake: a curious orange color, it’s devoid of vegetation or built structures. It looks like it might have been blasted by a spell or hideous event. It’s entirely flat and the surface sits just barely above the water level. Nor is it clear from what source Lake Goading is fed; the Nephil Mountains watershed goes straight to Snaff Bay. Maybe it’s fed by underground streams or an aquifer.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: This place is pretty messed up, huh, guys?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They pass between Thubudder Forest and Pulldevil Grove (did devils pull people’s arms and legs out, and give them life? or was it where the devil had his tail pulled, cast into Hell until he could recover his tail?) onto a level plain, in the far distance of which they see a prominent oxbow lake, a small town, and three conspicuous mountain peaks with ominous black shapes circling the apexes. (Or, perhaps the islands behind the peaks are still living volcanous spreading ash and rocks in small belches.)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The continue along a riverbank fed by marshes which propagate at the foot of the Braided Mountains. Flick and Drav consider returning to the gnoll village to wait for the peryton to show itself in the middle of its range. Flick pulls Vek out of its bag.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: Thanks for the fresh air; it gets pretty cramped in there. You want to know what you have to do to unify the peryton and a succubus kiss? I would need to see the peryton up close, since I haven’t done exactly this; if you were able to subdue her in some way I could probably pull it off; but if she’s in a state of violence, I probably couldn’t do it against her will. Usually the people who come to me are willing ascetics. pretty weak dudes, kinda like Hiero / Vengeance over here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Could you do it if she were unconscious?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yeah if you put her in a earthly concavity, sprinkle some dirt on us, allow me to sneak in there.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: metaphorically?</div>\n<div>- Vek (to Paros): You’ve got quite a few extraneous spirits hanging around you.</div>\n<div>- Paros: no … well, they aren’t extraneous.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Oh, cool, cool, I guess I’m just not seeing the whole picture. — they weren’t born with you, and they were never properly integrated. They might be Paros-itical. I’m grasping for words here. You’re a bit of a conundrum, spiritually.</div>\n<div>- Paros: is that a good kind of condundrum?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Sure, I like a challenge, or a puzzle — sure, it’s a neutral term. — Great, so Flick, you’ll just carry me in your arms from here on out, let me get some air.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I could stick you on Mule, in one of the panniers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Aw, sounds great, Mules are very close to the earth.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc and Paros appear skeptical at Vek’s very nature.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: I can try really … really hard to make this jar look like a face. (Beetle exoskeletons slide into place as eyes and a dead earthworm makes its mouth.) —I’m not hearing many compliments. All these creatures are dead, so … you should be pretty confident in me. (The creatures begin to slide to the bottom of the jar.)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick produces some fizzlecyst poison distillate to hand to Jean-Luc. Vengeance sees Flick passing something to Jean-Luc, probably a very high percentage alcohol beverage.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I hate to interrupt, but I think it would be best if I took that. I’m actually quite parched and could use a drink. If you don’t mind (and he goes to yoink it).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc bobbles the drink in going to protect it, and as it hot-potatoes among the three of them, Flick gets a firm hold on it. Flick backs up twenty feet —You really don’t want this in your mouth! - Vengeance: Look, we’re having fun here, playing fizzlesack, there’s no need to drink it. Jean-Luc offers Vengeance a slug from the silver star bottle.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Star comes over: Hey, y’all aren’t bogarting one of those drinks, are you? Maybe we should all get used to sharing and passing stuff around, you know?&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc, still distrustful of the blue being, has no idea what Startrella is referring to, nor what her intentions are.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Star: No response? You get so weird off this stuff. Fine, whatever. It’s not my place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Excuse me for not trusting someone who’s incorporeal and spirit controlling one of our friends.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: I’m totally corporeal, look at this! (She begins fizzlesacking).&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Vengeance starts fizzlesacking too —Yeah, Jean-Luc, look at this! You don’t need to drink to have fun. Flick waits for an opportune moment …</div>\n<div>- Star: Vengeance, check this out, go long!</div>\n<div>… to give Jean-Luc the poison vial. Vengeance monkishly hyperextends his arms in an attempt to go long. —No, your feet! says Star. Use your feet!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Oh, no, my feet are way too blistered.</div>\n<div>- Star: Well it’s a lot like … you can use any part of your body but your hands.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: well my hands are the only part of my body that doesn’t hurt right now. I guess I’ll go back over to Jean-Luc.</div>\n<div>- Star: Ok, that’s a little less cool, but sure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Mule goes over and nuzzles at Drav, who pets her back.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Oh, she doesn’t usually like dwarves! You see, the sorceress who turned her into a mule happens to be a dwarf herself.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: Really? Who was it?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I’m a little fuzzy on the details myself. She’s a dwarf. I was going to ask, since you have that book, which is written in dwarvish, is that correct? - I happen to be looking for a dwarf book, that tells of the creation of secret portals to the far realms. If you could keep a lookout, i’d be most appreciative.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: Suuuuuuure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: You two are talking about portals over here? It’s a lot of portal talk for one day? Don’t you ever just want to plant, enjoy what’s around you. — The silent treatment? you guys on a bunch of grass?</div>\n<div>- Vek: No, they don’t have grass, otherwise I’d ask them to plant it in me. And see about turning Hiero into that oak.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: should we get going? I hate to be the most motivated one, but … it’s getting a bit stale.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav considers a short rest; Flick suggests tending to Graal in some way so she can travel on her own. Fez comes over first; those who he passes expect to feel the warm, comforting, stimulating aura, but instead they catch the smell of dead fish and brine. Fez reaches out with one of his salves, rubs it on Graal’s skin, but instead of healing her, the skin becomes black and rubbery. —It must be some kind of interaction with the necromancy? Maybe the oil went bad. Carlos comes over and meditates for a moment, reaches out and touches Graal; the rubbery flesh sloughs off, and there is healthy tissue underneath, which Carlos causes to heal over [remove curse + healing word] , but without restoration of the two missing limbs (on the right-hand side).&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: Sorry about that, Graal. You’re very big.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Graal: I wouldn’t have made it through the portal if I didn’t lose those two arms. I’m pretty sure I can get these two arms back. We don’t have four for nothing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Are you going to be ok out here?</div>\n<div>- Graal: Just heading back home, now. Are there any places that would welcome a slowly healing ape guardian.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well there’s Seomra Crann, but don’t tell them we sent you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Graal: Heh. That’s a common sentiment among the Girallon. It’s considered polite not to mention who else you know as a shared friend.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: If they ask about a a sheriff and maritime law, just tell them the sentence has been carried out.</div>\n<div>- Graal: — Sure… i should be able to remember. But the road is safe?</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well it’s mostly druids, so they should be able to help</div>\n<div>- Graal: Yeah, druids are pretty great. I like it when they sew flowers into your hair.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: What’s that? Flowers in your hair? That sounds too good to be true.</div>\n<div>- Graal: Yeah, they’ll put them anywhere … you have hair. which it looks like you don’t have any of.</div>\n<div>- Star: Yeah, I like to keep it smooth; it’s better for swimming and surfing.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: It’s even more fun when they sew the flowers directly into your skin. so you’re in luck my friend.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: Bro, first with the hand-saking, and the flowers sewn into your skin: are you in a body-mod cult or something like that?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Yeah, it’s called the Mod Sqod, I think you’d like it— you seem like a chill character.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: Totally right!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Dope.</div>\n<div>- Star: you have some dope on you?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Vengeance gives Star some dothlarshian po’otay.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Unfortunately it has to be injected directly into your eyeballs.</div>\n<div>- Star: huh, well i bet i can find a way around it with my starmotes. but … yeah, thanks. here’s this.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A starmote travels out to Vengeance. It crystallizes into a large opal (worth about 50gp). —You’re just full of surprises, aren’t you? — Yeah, hey, take care of yourself. You gotta be careful with that bodymod stuff; sometimes you don’t recover; or it can be like you’re living out a traumatic past, that someone hung you up on hooks and tortured you. maybe find someone to talk to, or a chill crew.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: You remind me of some of my childhood. … and, hey — can you make more of these jewels?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: It takes something out of me each time. Tomorrow, sure, I could make another. Also, it’s a lot easier if someone’s just done me a solid. It worries me a little that you’re bringing this up, since, in the past, my people have been milked for the ability to create jewels and jems out of their own bodies, so maybe don’t bruit this about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: like … they’ve been killed with kindness?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: let’s say, turned into living resources to extract money from.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: don’t worry, i would never</div>\n<div>- Star: Yeah, no, I could tell, but I couldn’t help but think of it.</div>\n<div>- Flick: This has happened to you?</div>\n<div>- Star: Not to me, no, and on this plane, but not on this planet. they made some kind of special astral plane prison or soul cage. this dragon over here probably knows about it, it’s been written about in the history books. oh and probably these two, too. Drav and Parlos? they seem bookish.</div>\n<div>- Flick: so there might be something written about it?</div>\n<div>- Star: well it happened on this plane, so i don’t see why not; but it’s possible some kind never got a chance to be written about. history is written by the winners. it’s heavy stuff.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: who did this?</div>\n<div>- Star: well, there’s a group called the githyanki, and some are chill, and some tour around in battleships to look for loot and treasure. people think it was either them, or they were part of this slaving trade route, that they would provide people to those who wanted them.</div>\n<div>- Flick: did this happen to you? or are you relaying a oral history?</div>\n<div>- Star: no, i … read about it. but i remember the stuff you need to remember, like where’s the best po’otay, and who’s the chillest gang, and how to depillate yourself</div>\n<div>- Flick: were any of those people Fiends or creatures from the lower planes?</div>\n<div>- Star: you don’t mean like Macky “The Fiend” Matrakalis? that guy could run a town red. if you got on his train, man, you weren’t comin’ home for a week. He was something.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: tell me about it, man.</div>\n<div>- Star: You knew Macky?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: well, we kind of rolled in the same circles. for a little while. we weren’t close friends or anything. but i know the legends.</div>\n<div>- Star: now that I think about it, that makes a lot of sense. he was totally into getting inked up and all sorts of shit. if you’re into body mod, it’s totally possible you ran into each other.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: he did some stuff that even I shudder to think about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: even you? you’ve told me some things just today that made me wretch a bit, but in a good way,&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: is there any other way?</div>\n<div>- Star: ahaha, but yeah, there are bad ways. i start spewing out black holes and neutron stars; you have to stay out of the way; if i’m with people like yourself, you have to stay out of the way. plus i’m unconscious at the time.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: i’d really like to see that</div>\n<div>- Star: you’re asking a lot of me right there, — i can’t make opals for a month after one of those. i’m just shitting out fiery nebulae for the next couple weeks.</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: how did we get here?</div>\n<div>- Star: you were passing around some sweet liquids, and I wasn’t invited to partake.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick tries to get Aphelia’s attention and asks if she feels anything when she looks at the black shapes moving around the peaks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: they look like … remind me of the simurgh, you know, the bird on top of Seomra. the way it moves, it’s fluid. i’m not an ornithologist, and actually, my eyesite is poor, i’m sort of a close-seer from playing instruments, but i can’t _feel_ anything at this distance.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: bear in mind, i’m in way over my head here. I was mostly wondering if there is any affinity between you and calliope that would resonate over long distances.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: well if there’s any way to create a low-frequency resonance over that distance.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: you said some beasts can do it; … could a bear? — I’m reasonably certain that the cauldron from Shoemaker will let me turn into a bear. it does seem like i’d have to recharge it after use, but I offer that as a solution.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: can i see the helmet?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc [insight on aphelia/star: thnks Star could be modifying her message a bit?]. —Promise to give it back! Aphelia brings the helmet over to Graal, who touches it, at which point it increases to Graal’s head’s size, and Aphelia blows over the opening. Soon the sound drops so lo frequency and it can’t be heard. Flick disappears into the tree-line and readies her bow. After a few minutes, Aphelia perks up, brings the helmet back to Jean-Luc.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: I was able to create that sound; and yes, the peryton is there, and so are, i believe, her young .I got a very evil feeling from small, unformed creatures surrounding her.</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: That’s how we do. So you know where the peryton is.</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: yes, she’s on top of the tallest peak, facing us. —and gives Jean-Luc a kiss on the cheek.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez is out in the woods; Cyrowan comes over —Boy you got a kiss from a girl, how exciting!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: yeah, not everyone can be as irresistible as I am.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: boy oh boy you certainly are a good looking handsome oman, and a voice that hardly ever cracks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Just eat your vegetables and eight hours of sleep each night, you’ll get there.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: is that it?</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: well, and study … and listen to Fez.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: sure thing; i know we’ve been on rations here but maybe Flick’d find me some herbs? (oh man, a kiss on a cheek, what a day, i’ll never forget that one.)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick recaps the “seven layer grift” employed to get Aphelia out of Seomra Crann. (Jean-Luc, as sheriff, declared that Flick stole a brewery’s IP-A).</div>\n<div></div>\n<h2 id=\"thenextmorninglongrest\">the next morning (LONG REST)</h2>\n<div>Fez looks awful. —I kept trying to sleep but I had nightmares that I was trapped in a sea tempest, and then I would drown, and wake up, and the cycle would recur. It felt like I was being pulled under the water by something I couldn’t see or feel. Drav inspects the halfling and comes to the conclusion that he’s “exhausted” by 1 level and did not receive the benefits of a long rest.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: when did you start feeling this way?</div>\n<div>- Fez: I feel great all the time! (but he’s been weary since emerging from underground)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick recalls that Fez had a converzation with Abzu, a kraken, who had said that Fez made a contract with it to survive, when some of Vek’s soil spilled into the conch. Fez said he didn’t want any part of that. Since that, his efforts at healing have been largely unsuccessful. Flick tells everyone that a lot of calimari is pig anus. Or an elder beaver god named vanilla. The team realizes they can’t do anything to help Fez out in the long term.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Waking up, Jean-Luc can hear the noise of a wagon from about 1/4 mile away, accompanied by a few creatures, heading towards them from the north. It’s not clear where they’ve come from, other than “north” - perhaps the braided mountains or thereabouts?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>(For most of their time on the road they were headed west-east. two humanoid creatures walking along a cart. The cart/wagon looks like the ones they saw in the Forests of Horth, and it’s being pulled by a very large humanoid. ) Flick suggests continuing on without intercepting the caravan, and Jean-Luc expresses agreement. True to her analytical exhaustion, though, Flick describes the attack of a similar caravan group when they were transported to Horth.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: If anything it means they’re in trouble, and we should continue on our way</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: they’re probably just highwaymen, and we should avoid them</div>\n<div>- Paros: We should go meet them!</div>\n<div>- Drav: I’m all for continuing to head south. Altho …&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I’m thinking of trying to sell them Startrella, who’s somewhat of a golden goose.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: “golden goose,” yeah, that’s exactly what I was trying to think of the other day.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They determine that Startrella is a (non)binary star system, so mas changing gender pronouns. Flick suspects they might be able to find a book about it later.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: any guy strong enough to pull a full wagon is someone we don’t want to tangle with.</div>\n<div>- Paros: I’m sure at least Joan could pull a wagon. Not that she would want to.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They see that it’s a wagon which is meant to be pulled by a creature; it looks almost more like a wheelbarrow.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: maybe they attacked some merchants, but how do I know that the merchants didn’t deserve it.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Jeanluc we’re about to undertake a perilous adventure. Do you think we should trade and get supplies, or kill them and get experience points. (the offbeat meritocratic ranking system that prevailed at the monastery). we haven’t upgraded our weapons in a while. who knows what foes may await us in these mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I see no harm in stopping to stop to them.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick, flabberghasted at Vengeance’s uncharacteristic reasonableness, decides also to talk to them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The approaching group is traveling at a walking pace, and their arrival estimated at five minutes. Flick, seeing Fez in such a bad way, thinks about the weird incel Cyrowan (incyrowan), and commits to watching closely the drippy human whenever he’s within 20 feet of fez. Paros wonders aloud at this, and Flick declares that something is off about him, and that he came from underground, which is enough to be skeptical of him. Paros doesn’t remember anything interesting from the Xanthuc temples because he was tied to a sled being pulled by Mule.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Vengeance remembers that he’d carved the name of the dwarven sorcererr Amabelle into his skin. (and her stylishness)</div>\n<div>- Star: did you say amabelle? well she used to run with the fiend; she was a tatoo artist and she did his first tats, and they started running together. she’s a real legend in the biz; her tattoos could do pretty much anything. stuff as far as healing people, or giving them really big appetites, just a huge puff of some sweeet grass; she could eliminate a hangover if she wanted.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I can’t believe how small a world this is. she was basically under my nose this whole time, if she knew the Fiend. if i could find the Fiend I could get to her. but it’s a shame that he’s dead.</div>\n<div>- Star; it is too bad. it’s too bad he couldn’t live up to his namesake and live forever in the underworld, but we all have to embrace the cycle of life.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: he really went out with a bang, being thrown into that volcano.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: yeah some people say that everytime you breathe in a little bit of ash, from your stogie, that you’re breathing in the Fiend. and i love that view, that he’s impeding my breathing a little bit and could one day cause my death through the growth of cancerous flesh. it’s a really great thing to look at things. and what you say about the world being small, this planet for sure is really small. i got a look at the world’s blue book, and there’s only, say, maybe 500 to 600 of them , but other worlds, they have millions. i mean, like, entities.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Paros has no idea who Startrella is somehow. Star passes off redescribing himself to Paros.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: i really liked graal; can you imagine how many swords she could wield at once.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The caravan comes into view. They appear to be hobgoblins, and the one is clearly very very large but still hobgoblin in shape if not size.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: i’m not sure i want to give them startrella anymore; we’ve kind of bonded. i’m not sure what i’ve gotten us into.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: how about we all come out of the trees so they don’t think we’re trying to ambush them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc stands in the middle of the road with a friendly wave. The huge hobgoblin looks like it’s been carved from wood, and has terrifying white eyes (a hobgolem if you will, says Flick, bragging of her intelligence) . the one on the west shouts out “and who be there!”</div>\n<div>- flick : travellers looking merely to trade news of the road.</div>\n<div>- Glug: which way are you going?</div>\n<div>- flick: towards the mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: and what pace might you be keeping? should we go ahead or stay behind?</div>\n<div>- Flick : as fast as we can</div>\n<div>- Glug: our pace is limited here by Udrek. (grunts)</div>\n<div>- Flick: your companion is … i’ve never seen anything like him. what is he and how did you find each other</div>\n<div>- Glug: yes, hes almost one of a kind. we grew up in the same town; you’d consider it a town; for hobgoblins it’s almost a city.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: i kind of wanted to know, is why is he so huge</div>\n<div>- Glug: it turns out if you don’t limit the growth of certain hobgoblins they can grow illimitably large. he’s only six months old</div>\n<div>- Paros: oh so he’s like a Gold Fish</div>\n<div>- Glug: he’s certainly worth his weight in gold, and has the eyes of a dead fish, but those qualities belie a quite active mind.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick : Udrek, how does this day find you, if I mind you.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Day. Today. Warm. Arms Strong. // Ever thought. How. Universe. Infinite?</div>\n<div>- Star: yeah man, the universe is so big it’s hard to get your mind around. this Udrek, he’s definitely got smarts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Agree. With. Blue. Lady.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>&lt;&lt;The gang pauses.&gt;&gt;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: what do you have in your wagon, guys. When we saw you on the road we thought we could trade with you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: mostly we do wholesale; we’re bringing some goods down to the coast. we get money from the owners of the ships, and they take our goods and try to make a profit. It’s really just “fine” commodities.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: so you’re middlemen?</div>\n<div>- Glug: you could call us that&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: what sort of commodities do you trade in?</div>\n<div>- Glug: high-value metals and gems; as to middlemen — we do most of the sourcing ourselves; we find these things on ancient or more recent battlefields.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: you’re scavengers!</div>\n<div>- Glug: that’s a bit of a slur, but i think not entirely inaccurate.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (remembers) growing up around cressida, it lies … just north of the town where i grew up, the border had been fought over by smaller kingdoms constantly in centuries past, and there was a lot of this kind of unsavory trade. as individuals, turning up whole pieces of metal from ages past, they were alright, but it left a bad taste in my mouth).</div>\n<div>- Paros: can we take a look at some of the stuff you’re trading?</div>\n<div>- Glug: it’s a kind offer, but we do have contractual obligation to meet weight requirements witih the wholesalers. we were right at the limit when we got all this stuff together. anything less and we’d have to renegotiate.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: if there’s something of value and little weight …&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: we’re a bit vulnerable to an assault, but we like to keep a low profile. you looked trustworthy enough.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: it may be to your advantage.</div>\n<div>- Glug: typically, disagreements this sophistical we leave to Udrek to sort out in his massive woody mind, a nice “pithy’ answer as to whether or not it would be worth. but we’ll just proceed to the coast if it’s all the same to you.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>(Flick wonders how battlefield scavengers are finding gems, but can’t quite get a read on Glug. However, Paros’s knowledge of history, knows that a lot of hobgoblins claim resources that are other peoples; either throught military might or subterfuge; these could be ill-gotten gains, but not all hobgoblins operate that way. they might not be “old” battlefield finds; but they could scavenge from recent battlefields, or other hobgoblins, or they could be highwaymen.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>(Can Paros’s eye see residual emotions left on the items of previous owners. — he would have to be able to see the object. Instead, he casts “detect thoughts”)</div>\n<div>[- maybe i’ll let him cast detect thoughts from the eye; like it gives him an extra slot for certain spells]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Able to step behind a rock, Paros surreptitiously screams and clutches his brain, beseiged by an infinitude of inner spirits, disguising the fact that he’s casting a fairly commonplace spell. &lt;&lt;&lt;Udrek is engaged in hypercomplex mathematical equations about economy. Glugranok is getting a little impatient but still seems confident and self-assured. &gt;&gt;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc can see that there is bast or stuffing coming out of the crates; given how heavy on the wheels it’s lying, and how hard Udrek is pulling, can gather that there is a lot of metals or minerals. it’s probably not raw materials, or they’d be doing it in larger quantities. they are probably “goods”, not bricks of ore. Paros tries to press deeper with Detect Thoughts on Glugranok, who surprisingly pushes the probing psyche out of his mind, ending the spell. Paros is able to tell that something else is aiding the spell’s defeat, not just the hobgoblin’s innate wisdom.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Glug: ok, well if you’re moving swiftly — we don’t want to encounter each other again — we’ll just post up here and wait for you to move on?</div>\n<div>- Paros: you’ll never meet anyone who’s as comfortable with awkward as am i</div>\n<div>- Flick: Udrek, um, what’s in the cart.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Finished. Goods.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc (to party): well if these fine gentlemen don’t want to sell their wares, perhaps we should be on our way.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: Udrek, why did you leave the rest of them behind?</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Friends. With. Me. Here.</div>\n<div>- Flick: I saw the rest of your caravan.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: What? Just this cart I pull.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: ok, Glug, quite far to the north of here i saw the remains of a caravan i’d be very surprised to find you’re not a part of. who wanted this stuff so badly they were willing to kill for it?</div>\n<div>- Glug: we came straight from the Braided Mountains. How much further north was it?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(He’s telling the truth from coming from the Braided Mountains. But why are they pulling the same kind of cart? And _what_ had been pulling Ox’s cart?)</div>\n<div>- Paros: It must have sucked to pull the cart for such a long time.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Like. Diversion. From. Brain.</div>\n<div>- Paros: have you tried whiskey?</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Whiskey. Depressant. Need. Body. Simulated.</div>\n<div>- Vek: heh Flick what’s this guy talking about. i heard something about a body. stimulus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick runs over and grabs Vek off Mule, holding him on her hip like a laundry basket. ``—There’s something seriously strange about the guy with the cart. Can you tell anything about whether his consciousness is supposed to be in his body?``</div>\n<div>- Vek: you’re gonna have to get me a bit closer. From here he looks like he’s properly … woven … his body is massive and treelike (again, Vengeance might want to get in on this), but looks like a perfectly normal creature. But like his eyes look a lot like the face i was making for you guys, with the dead beetles — remember? — i feel like i was basing it off a pretty handsome template. look at this hobgoblin: “that’s a big handsome hobgoblin!”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[History from Drav 20 and Flick 18]. Drav, would know that there have been skirmishes between Longbeard, Broadbeam, and Greyknuckle clans. however, the areas under those clans, and up northwest, they are rumored to have hobgoblins; what’s strange is that the hobgoblins almost never work with humans from Cressida, but the guy Ox you saw yesterday was human. It would be strange for them to be working together, but at the same time hobgoblins do have access to both sides of the mountain because their tunnels run. and they are using old dwarf tunnels that the dwarves left or been forced out of.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc believes that, even if they’re scavengers carrying out a contract, that’s just the world we live in.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: we’re going to head south, and we won’t take up anymore of your time.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: oh, no, I’m sure Udrek wouldn’t mind a break. (they grab some provisions from the cart and start eating them — mostly jerky, biscuits, light ale, which Udrek eschews. The hobgolem almost seems to root himself securely in the soil. )</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick examines the large creature again: was he pleading with them? is he under duress? Flick doesn’t detect that Udrek is resistant to manual labor. Drav, acquainted with minerals, detects a glint of metal from the hairline of Udrek and Glugranok. Neither is wearing a helmet; but they do both have long hair. Remembering the advanced roboticism of dot-dot, they wonder if the “hobgoblins” are actually cyborg for a brief moment. “Organiborgs!” Paros shouts out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Paros uses his third eye; [charisma check with advantage (DC 17)] there is some kind of mind control going on, the two guys in the front. The lady in the back is now hiding behind the cart. He does a crazy dance in the field attempting to disguise a sequence of message cantrips cast in tandem informing the party. Vengeance gets a little jealous.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vengeance: hey could you teach me some of those moves?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yeah Paros, I haven’t seen Fez do anything like that. you look like a dance master.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros (reluctantly): yyyy…eah</div>\n<div>- Udrek: What. Dancing. Business!</div>\n<div>- Glugranok: Is this how you all get started on a journey?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: what ho, friend! your companions have introduced themselves. we haven’t had the pleasure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Nerch (hiding behind the wagon): Meeeeeee? awhy are you laughing??&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: come on out</div>\n<div>- Nerch: I have very delicate skin.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav tries unsuccessfully to sneak up parallel with Nerch.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: your dwarven friend here seems to be lost. I thought we’d agreed you’d head south.</div>\n<div>- Drav: Just admiring the stones here.</div>\n<div>- Glug: Oh, I can tell you quite a lot. I’ve devoted a great majority of my life to studying the stones in the braided mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav can’t get a good sightline on Nerch with all the trees in the way. —What about the stones?</div>\n<div>- Glug: we’ve taken over some of the old tunnels that were abandoned in the day, and so I like to fancy myself a dilettante, we could expand the tunnels; hobgoblins need a bit more vertical space underground than dwarves. i’ve learned quite a bit about gems and metals. it also helps my work when we go around the battlefields extracting those things left behind.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Paros hypothesizes that perhaps these mind control effects are why Detect Thoughts didn’t work. He and Drav can’t figure out why the metal is so familiar to them. The color, though, is a reddish-gold. not like Paros’s bracer. Flick by now has been alerted to the circlets; she approaches closer, around the wagon, to try to engage Nerch — she finds her shyness highly suspicious.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: you said your skin is really delicate. this wagon isn’t covered: it’s not keeping you out of the sun.</div>\n<div>- Nerch: you can see that the sun is coming from the south-west; if i take cover here under the corner it won’t affect me as much. And you can feel this terrible wind passing, can’t you? it’s much nicer to be on the leeward side of Udrek here.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Leeward. Cover. For. Nerch. Pleasure.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Nerch is wearing a robe over light leather armor and carrying a staff.&nbsp;</div>"}

God help us if we discover something dangerous with him fish-odoring all over the place. Flick, looking around desperately for a place to send Fez, sees the fairly large town nestled on the north banks of [x] bay</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyrowan: We should go over to Sandford, on the sandy northern banks!

We're going to be after the Tiara Mafia next.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>They are no longer able to see the Tripod behind them. They can, however, see the clear blue waters of Tull Bay to their east. Sandford on the north shore, and a cluster of small villages that attend the projectionsi and island in the bay. (They are repeased<a href=\"Reassured.\">^repeased</a> to know that their companions should be safe there in the pretty sleepy villages.) [History] (Jean-Luc has a reliable contact, his fence, \"Spindler,\" (who does not know Jean-Luc's real name either) lives on the village on the far side, the larger and more urban of the collective-of-four. Spindler sells things to an underworld boss known as The Jaguar. All except Flick know that the city is known for its experimental artificers and laboratory technicians -- perhaps they have contacts at Red Fox University? -- and suspect that tentamens[^tentamen] involving audio technology to direct undesirable soundwaves, or visuo-hallucinatory images such as scarecrows hundreds of feet tall, may protect them from the peryton and perhaps the tripods and other constructs. On the other hand, they may have been able to harness the power of naturally occurring geological magic such as lode stones or ley lines to the same purposes. Goblinsmite Peak, where Aphelia pointed as the location of the Peryton, is the tallest of the three</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jean-Luc: We're not goblins, so we should be ok.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flick: If it was goblins doing the smiting it would be SmiteGoblin peak?</p></li>\n<li><p>Jean-Luc: Jean-luc cares not for your semantic argument.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flick: Is anyone trepidatious about proceeding without our full complement?</p></li>\n<li><p>Vengeance: how outmatched are we?

Flick approaches one of the homesteaders. She gives a general description of the Peryton, and that a village to the northwest hired us, and she's wondered if they've had livestock or people disappearing, and if they've seen this thing casting a shadow over their lands. The human farmer: \"It took my uncle the other week. No one particularly liked him: he was always asking for flour and sugar, we had to loan him money for his gambling; we kindof thought it was karma, but it does sound like more people who have even well-loved relatives are reporting that the bodies or organs are being taken. We know it as The Violet Shadow.\" Flick communicates with her sheepdog, Belavert, \"sounded like a glider, and it didn't scare me at all.\" Then it runs around everyone and sniffs them. Flick gives it some jerky, and it asks for more, and then offers to herd their sheep. \"Has the peryton been harassing livestock?\" \"It hasn't gone after my sheep; its shadow has passed over me and it didn't scare me at all!\" Flick detects a bit of bluster in the dog, and offers some fizzlecyst jerky to the farmer: \"This isn't going to make up for losing a hand around the farm, but I want to thank you for your time.\" \"Oh, is that some of that cave jerky -- thanks, I guess.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Vengeance: And if you're lying to us, we're going to come back, burn your house down, and kill everyone you love.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jean-Luc: Ignore him.</p></li>\n<li><p>Farmer: It looks like he needs a shower and a haircut.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vengeance: It's my standard farewell.</p></li>\n<li><p>Farmer: Farewell to you too, shore. Hopefully Greyson (child?) likes this jerky. Farmers here prefer stuff from the land, not under the rocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flick: It takes all kinds.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flick: Ok, it seems like this thing only takes humanoids.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jean-Luc: FUcking druids and gnoll-eating monsters.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flick: I think the druids got what was coming to them. [The DM reminds them that they did say have other cells.]</p></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>They come across a lake that sits at the foot of Goblinsmite Peak. [Perception] Across the way they see a ramshackle building set back into one of the armpits of rock. There might at one point have been active paths leading to it, and they can still detect a trod path leading around the lake.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: Should we make camp here first? This looks like a half-a-day-er mountain to me. Could take all (rest of) day, but with more treacherous choices might take less.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: getting there in the dark might not be the worst thing in the world</li>\n<li>Flick: Ideally i'd like to take it completely by surprise and get it \"Aphelia'd\" without further fuss.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: We might … not … have to fight it. I think we don't have to set up camp. If we hike up there it's still going to take some time to hike back down.</li>\n<li>Flick: True, we do have Aphelia with us, and she's not an outdoors woman. Though it's not like we'll be ascending by handholds and stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick walks over to Mule's saddlebags and pulls out Vek's crockery. \"Sorry if it was rough back there, we had to beat a hasty retreat.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vek: it's not like a dream-within-a-dream, it was more like great suspension, good hydraulics, the whole deal.</li>\n<li>Flick: We're getting pretty close to the peryton. How close does Aphelia have to be? For you to reunite them?</li>\n<li>Vek: It's preferable that, if the peryton doesn't want this, that it's unconscious and buried in some dirt that's conducive to me infiltrating me with my spirit. Aphelia should be pretty close to that dirt. Anything more than that I'll have to strain a little bit.</li>\n<li>Flick: Ok guys we might end up having to fight this thing. We want to catch it when it's roosting, so we should head up now, but I'm really curious about this lake hut.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: if anyone needs a healing hand, i've been using this severed hand as a backscratcher.</li>\n<li>Vek: What's that now? (and some interrogative dirt goes flying out of the vase)</li>\n<li>Drav: at some point we will need to rest for health and spells.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Turns out Carlos had healed them somewhat before they separated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: let's check out this shack, and maybe we could rest a spell and have aphelia play us a soothing saraband.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>They come around to the shack, with a shingle announcing Stato's Den. From the outside it looks like it was probably a bar, possibly for miners. Flick hypothesizes that there are mineshafts in the mountain. Jean-Luc would know that the mountains were mined for precious minerals and metals. Definitely gold and silver; rumors that they were mined for certain gemstones valuable to sorcerers. Jean-Luc had thought that people had abandoned the mines here 10-20 years ago. Obviously there are still scavengers who come in, but organized mining has stopped.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-Luc: Sometimes corporate packs up quickly enough that there's a few bottles left lying around.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc steps into the bar. Flick looks for a way to enter stealthily [13]. Flick is off today. The door creaks on its hinges; you peek in and see a ramshackle bar with a few tables. There's a squat stone statue in the corner, and a man behind the bartop leaning against the frame of a door leading into a back room. [Is it creepy? because the last time we walked into a nice bar there was unpleasantness.] Flick remembers from her youth a story of a dog sitting at a burning table saying to itself \"This is fine.\" But everything here seems cool. Flick knocks on the door, \"Hey there, you open.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: Erm, yeah, we're open. It depends what you want from us. Just beer?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc thinks, \"Ah, my people.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: It also depends on what you're willing to spend.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc walks into the center of the bar [Investigation low]. He sees that there is no \"top shelf\" of alcohol, there's just beer taps. The person behind the bar is human or half-elf, vaguely like Vengeance, with a receding hairline, wearing loose tattered red robes with dirty brown tunic underneath. They won't make eye contact, and they have a fleshy, undercooked, pale face.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beer it is! says Jean-Luc.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I like this guy's style. I'll take one as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin grabs four stone-carved mugs and …</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: has this bar been following us?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>… Flick sits down and joins Jean-Luc. Mule stays outside with Joan, but Aphelia comes in. Palchin delivers the drinks. [Perception] Drav and Flick can tell that the beer looks and smells like pure lakewater. Flick and the others sip at it. Jean-Luc has acquired a sophisticated palette, there was that one time the Gaol Maidens hazed you and took you through a fish market and made him drink the fish slurry. Vengeance, all the times your parents would do nearly the same thing and dunk his head underwater during a fishing trip. There is the homeopathic memory of fishiness to the water. But, oddly enough, it is moderately alcoholic. [Insight - is this malicious?] Flick, \"This very subtle piscine allure evades me.\" (Flick associates the taste with the stone). Jean-Luc knows that, not only is this what's usually served, but it's also as alcoholic as a beer. Flick <em>sotto voce</em> \"What the fuck is this?\" Jean-Luc: Alcohol can be distilled from different animals; they made it from fish. I've had worse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: There's certainly no greater compliment than having it said of one's beer that someone has \"had worse.\" If I could shake the hand of the man who said that.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc reaches out his hand. As he goes to shake his hand, Palchin's tray spills a bit of lake water onto the Lydia sword. (\"No big deal; things get a little splashed.\", and goes to wipe it down. - It looks a little duller in places, but nothing to worry about. But on second glance, it almost perfectly matches the water spots.) Jean-Luc whispers to Flick, \"Maybe stop drinking; something might be up with this guy.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: DO you happen to have a swish-bucket? Something that I can spit out into? I like to swish it around in my mouth a little bit, make sure I'm getting all the notes.</li>\n<li>Palchin: All the 'notes'? You think this is some sort of musical beer?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I'm detecting a bit of sturgeon, perhaps some pike -- what kind of fish are you using exactly?</li>\n<li>Palchin: FIsh? no, we use the mountain lakewater here to brew the beer. If you can detect that, you have a very sensitive palette.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I grew up with fish, and they have a familiar taste to me.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Oh, a kindred fisherman. I grew up fishing too. I just assumed that that smell sticks to you and affects everything you taste and smell from then on.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I'm no fisherman. It's kind of you to say that.</li>\n<li>Palchin: then why do you have all these fish hooks stuck into your fingers?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I had forgotten about those. This is a little bit of ornamentation.</li>\n<li>Palchin: We don't go for that sort of urban decoration around here. Just bread and beer folks. When you're in the mines, you don't want any extra metal on you. you never know if a spark could turn you into dust.</li>\n<li>Flick: You're talking like mining is still going on.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Mining, yeah. ALl the miners still come in after their shifts for drinks.</li>\n<li>Flick: I was going to ask why you were still here. We've been sent to investigate a presence casting a dark shadow over this mountain. [Insight 16]</li>\n<li>Palchin: Shadowy presence? No, definitely not. (His eyes dart back and forth; he's hiding something, certainly.)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick is distracted by the smell of stonefish and looks down just as Palchin's eyes betray him. Vengeance sees small divots in the wooden flooring where it's worn through to the mountain rock (that he could use as an expectorative receptacle). Jean-Luc is certain that this is not part of any criminal syndicate, outpost or not. This guy might not even know that some of the major recent historical events have occurred.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: is this all you want?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance goes to spit the swished beer into Palchin's … mouth! Perhaps luckily, the attempt goes past his face. \"Well if you don't have a spittoon I'm not sure where I should be spitting. I apologize; I haven't been out in the real world for a while.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: spitting in this place indicates that you despise the brew, or are about to get into an altercation</li>\n<li>Vengeance: On the contrary , it means I'm trying to appreciate the symphony of flavors. I'm trying to keep my palette clean and my head clear.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Oh so you really need a palette cleanser. … This reminds me of an incident from my youth, in which a distillery nearby was offering samples; I took a swig and spat it back into my tasting cup. I was then forced to drink my own backwash. It's only because of that incident that I'm excusing your lack of decorum</li>\n<li>Vengeance: That's gross, why would you even tell us that</li>\n<li>Palchin: I thought I would find an empathetic ear in you but i haven't.</li>\n<li>Flick (to no one): yet more disdain for the working class amongst the adventuring bourgeoisie.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>He brings back to Vengeance a bowl full of dried algae flakes. As he goes to offer it to Vengeance, [Dex] high on the efflorescence of fish-notes from the water, and the sense-memory it's given him of his childhood when his nimbleness was at its peak, he almost unconsciously sidesteps as Palchin spills water where Vengeance's short sword was a moment ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: Ah, you'll excuse me, it's been a while since i've had to retrieve a palette cleanser for a patron.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: well we'll see if you get any tip from us.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I haven't even collected the drink tab, so I wasn't hopeful.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: what is the tab</li>\n<li>Palchin: one silver?</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc (tossing a gold): with tip</li>\n<li>Palchin: we only take honest coin here; tip is for an economy which doesn't pay its workers equitable. With a gold you're welcome to drink as long as you'd like. We also have rooms above.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>1:30 pm, ish.</p>\n<p>Drav, examining the stone sculpture [24], sees that it is of a squat dwarf, maybe half Drav's height. 2 or 2.5 feet tall. A female dwarf, whose eyes are set in an intense glare focused on a point 10 feet in front of itself, and its mouth is wide open as if screaming or about to scream. The quality of the stonework indicates that it is not a typical hill or mountain dwarf. This may be one of the Underdark dwarves, either who carved it, or who it's meant to resemble. it doesn't bring to mind a deity, but it looks purposive, as though not meant for worship. there are candles around it which are lit and have melted. There are flints and other rock flakes in piles or cairs nearby.</p>\n<p>The light beer, meant to be consumed all day in lieu of untrustworthy water, gets them reasonably happy. Flick and Vengeance can hear Palchin speaking in the back, with the occasional hissing or splashing noises audibly interpolated. Flick, looking for a believable pretext to approach the bar, surveys two pictures hung on the far wall. They are arranged such that the subjects appear to comprise part of the same body. The bottommost picture is a sea-serpent, long and thin with a head and tail; on top is a picture of a mountain lake remarkable like the one outside; the image is from the side; steam rises from the lake and the image of a woman's silhouette emerges from the lake's surface.</p>\n<p>Flick stands and makes a show of taking in the lake picture. As she approaches, [INT 4, WIS 8]. Flick finds herself completely paralyzed, retreating into her own mind, and is unable to experience what's going on around her. To those behind her she appears completely rigid. Drav notices this, but Vengeance is looking for locations to spit while Jean-Luc seeks to frustrate his efforts. Drav walks over to Flick and can determine her sight-line on the picture. Drav adjusts Flick's head; she still appears to be paralyzed. A glimmer of horror and ultimate confusion is apparent on her face, as though she's been confronted with something incomprehensible. Drav wonders aloud if they should skedaddle. Vengeance finishes his drink, precipitating a comfortable inebriation, walks over to the bar, and puts his shortsword onto the counter, you know, subtle-like. Oh, and he swept all the drinks off the table and shouted \"Enough!\" when standing up. [Intimidation] Quick motions are heard in the back, and Palchin peaks her head out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What's going on here? Why is your weapon laid across the bar?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: do you mind if i leave it there. it's a bit uncomfortable to carry.</li>\n<li>Palchin: no, not at all, let me clean around your sword for you. (He soaks a rag and goes to squeeze it out near the sword. )</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance grabs his hand to try to get him to squeeze the rag out into his mouth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: this is a classic dare from my younger days. we tended to put it in a shot glass first. Which of your friends are up for the challenge? it can't just be you. i'll take you on but i thought you wanted to introduce your friends to the game.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: It's not a challenge, I would hate to see you waste all of that fish water.</li>\n<li>Palchin: oh, this isn't the brew ….</li>\n<li>Vengeance: IS IT NOT?!</li>\n<li>Palchin: hey, are we going to have a problem here?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance [Perception n20] can tell it's the \"fish water\" as they have begun to call the beer (although Palchin had gone to say it wasn't) and also have a crown (supertooth), Vengeance can feel it begin to dissolve in his mouth. \"My supertooth! Not again!\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: what happened the first time?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I came up behind my mule too suddenly, and she knocked it out of my head. Just the crown part, she's quite accurate with her kicks.</li>\n<li>Palchin: that was her intent?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Yeah, she wouldn't want me to lose an actual tooth.</li>\n<li>Palchin: that depends how well you treat her. do you feed her … every day.?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Let's not get into it. the point is, YOU don't seem to care about my supertooth, nor about your bar, if you're pouring beer onto it to clean it. Let's have it, my man.</li>\n<li>Palchin: your sword --- should be cleaned as well by the waters, as the bar would be. -- this is what i use for cleaning: a mouth, sword, or bar.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: burping twice, the classic sound of a liar!</li>\n<li>Palchin: it can clean a mind</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Everyone, this man is hiding something!</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Meanwhile, Drav's furious signalling has alerted Jean-Luc to Flick's predicament. Drav goes to slap Flick, but, having to hop up, barely grazes Flick's jaw, and she doesn't react.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-Luc: look, we came in here looking for a drink. I've gotta be honest, I've killed people for less, please unparalyze my friend.</li>\n<li>Palchin: what's the matter with your friend? i've been in the back room this whole time.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: She appears to be paralyzed. I assume that's your doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin looks at Flick, comes around the bar, \"It does look that way -- I believe this should remediate things.\" Drav is well aware that Palchin is about to pour more of this water on your shield, and on Flick's rapier. Drav pushes Palchin back out of the way, holding her shield and flick on the other side of her body.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: I was just trying to splash some water in your friend's face! that usually wakes people up.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: She's not asleep, she's paralyzed.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I have night-terrors --</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: One last time, what is going on here?!</li>\n<li>Palchin: I'm trying to serve some people in the off season. I guess I do get a little lonely. I'm sorry if I appear too aggressive. You gave me a full gold, I'm just trying to be as officious as possible.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: WHY IS MY FRIEND PARALYZED</li>\n<li>Palchin: Your guess is as good as mine. I think a good hearty slap would do it. The dwarf barely grazed her cheek. It looks like a bit of confusion. Strange, unaccountable things do happen on this mountain that can't be accounted for.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Drav is too focused on keeping Flick safe, ready for another splash attempt. Vengeance, with his specific connection with the weirdos of the world, is sure that Palchin is lying. Palchin knows why Flick is paralyzed, and what her condition is. Palchin may, Vengeance infers, have been a monk, and the means by which he subdues his natural reactions is monklike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: Jean-Luc, why don't you let me handle this. I think this matter requires a bit of delicacy. Palchin, if you don't tell us what you're up to, we're going to burn your house down and kill everybody that you love. I take that back … Palchin, what monastery did you happen to study in. You seem like you might follow the ways of the Tranquil monks.</li>\n<li>Palchin: How did you know?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I guess you could say that I'm a \"weirdo\" like yourself.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I wasn't going to say that, but … that's up to you. But yes -- I'm a monk of the Ivory Empire. But that was decades, if not almost a hundred years ago.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I seem to recall we used to play that Monastery in stickball.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Stickball, yes! It's been quite a while. It certainly does bring back the memories. Some of our fellow monks were lucky enough to have their limbs amputated and replaced with sticks so as to play the game in its purest form.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: The game has changed a lot since then. These days everyone seems to be \"stick-doping\". It's sort of lost its lustre.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Stick-doping?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: No, like replacing their limbs with sticks. It's kind of unfair, don't you think.</li>\n<li>Palchin: well i think it's unfair in a religious sense, but maybe not in a physiomechanical sense. but of course, the religious sense is the most important. we're agreed there.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: given that the purpose of stick-ball is to be as much like a stick as you can</li>\n<li>Palchin: That's interesting, our monastery always had a different take on it, which was it's important to be as much like a ball impaled by a stick as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick begins to come out of her madness, Drav betwixt her and Palchin. Flick still hears the alien words being spoken resonating in her ears, but she's been turned to look into Drav's beautiful grey eyes; grey like the mountain ranges seen from the plains, and you have a gross puffy man, dripping sweat and water, standing next to you. She shouts and leaps backwards, adopting a defensive stance and reaching for her bow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: See, your friend is better than ever.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: doesn't explain how.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc [Insight n.1] feels like Palchin is making honest efforts, and, since Vengeance is going off, you might be beginning to side in part with Palchin. He advisedly delays reaching for his sword. Flick, meanwhile, is looking around for cues; seeing Jean-Luc just as puzzled, she does not know what to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: Hey, barkeep, is there a bathroom back there i could use? after all that fish oil</li>\n<li>Palchin: you were drinking oil?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: no, it's great, it's not a criticism, that your drinks seem to be high in omega 3s</li>\n<li>Palchin: sure, like aromatic oils. well most of the miners take a leak outside. this isn't a spot that has an internal bathroom. there is a bathroom over that way (west)</li>\n<li>Vengeance: do you have maybe a sink back that there? I need privacy. I won't be able to go, standing outside. i'm just gonna head back there if that's ok.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin does appear to reluctantly allow Vengeance to go back.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: I suppose if you do need privacy… The outhouse is an enclosed structure, but it does have that little crescent-shaped window. if you wanna head to the back, immediately go right, there's a trough sink for cleaning up paint brushes. you're sure this isn't a number 2?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: no, just the usual water colors. If you're a fellow artist, you'll know what i mean.</li>\n<li>palchin: i do primarily utilitarian painting. I like to keep that sign out front fresh.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: oh yeah, no, that's primo work.</li>\n<li>palchin: i was just out there the other day working on that. keep the chains bright as the sun, and the sign level as a carpenter's level.</li>\n<li>vengeance≈: i would say that's what drew us to this place</li>\n<li>Palchin: no, i got one: level as the palaces of Modron. don't be back there too long; a lot of people get scared, -- there are a few mannequins back there under sheets; you might think they're ghosts, but they're not, they're mannequins.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: It'll be just like going at home.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I tailor my own clothes, is why. so i have bespoke mannequins for bespoke clothes. if you're a tailor you can't sew it on yourself.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: yeah, no, I can't imagine a more comfortable environment in which to urinate. thank you. (And he runs into the back room)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick looks to Drav for some clue as to the events of the last five minutes; the wizard is just as nonplussed. Flick thinks she hears outside the main door of the bar the sound of hooves skittering and sliding. She immediately runs and looks out the door.</p>\n<p>In the back room, Vengeance attempts to discern the source of the slurping sounds. to the right is the trough, the mannequins covered in drop cloths are there; some paint cans and an area for repairs. there are quite a few kegs; some look empty, some full. There is a shelf of glasses and dishrags.</p>\n<p>Vengeance shouts from the back: \"I guess we're fine letting everyone in the town die while we have a drink?!\"</p>\n<p>[^tentamen]: Experimental apparatus.</p>"}

'shithead'\"&nbsp;</div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<h1 id=\"recap\">Recap</h1>\n<div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div>- Shoemaker dumps a double-handful of goodberries onto the ground, walks to the nearest table and puts the vase full of earth there.</div>\n<div>- Meanwhile, Flick is rolling around on the ground, trying to put out a fire.</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I thought that, being a wood-elf, you would have been circumspect enough to look around for the source of your magic. You just thought it was coming to you from nowhere in particular?</div>\n<div>- Flick: I don’t know what you want me to say; that’s kind of how magic works.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Well maybe for wizards, but not for plane-walkers like you. You’re going to have to reconcile yourself to this.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- (As Shoemaker has a hard time getting both Flick and Fez in the circumference of the vase's effect) Flick: my flailing around has paid off!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- The jar of earth starts to tremble and soil spills over the top, down the table, and starts to engulf Shoemaker. She dissolves into a hilly lump of flesh. Resonating out of the jar: &lt;&lt;Return to what you are&gt;&gt; Fez for a moment feels himself start to collapse into a fleshmound, but he shakes his head and steels himself and the vision disappears.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- (Flick remembers that Onfalon told her a long time ago that Shoemaker had spirits in her basement which people came to pray to.)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc goes to stab Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: why are you going after me? My concern is with this spoiled ranger who keeps grabbing things as if from a void.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: as weird as they are, these people are my friends.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: So you’re a little thief too?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Little? I’d like to think I'm 'medium' to 'renowned'.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Are we talking about height or notoriety?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Why not both?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: why does it always have to be about height?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: semantically arguing with a demon-bear is not one of the things I imagined doing.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: your extra-little cleric friend over here could tell you that.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: she’s talking about Carlos.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Yeah, the dwarf. Compared to you, Fez, he’s a giant. With that robe, it’s hard to tell gender, in case I used the wrong one right there.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: You’ve been backpedalling like this since you got here.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: TBH this isn’t my natural habitat. I’m used to the woods.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: You still have to be better.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I do my best. What are you saying I don’t do well enough? You all are the ones with privilege. Ganging up on me in a dungeon. This feels like a zoo enclosure.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: YOU came in HERE. … This is going to get GRIZZLY.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I’m not a black, polar, or grizzly bear. Are you another cleric? You don’t appear to have a deity you dedicate yourself to?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: That’s a solid maybe. But this fight is going to be a LOSS for you. You came to talk about goodberries, but we’re going to say goodbye. Also you’re a metaphysical construct that doesn’t exist outside this dungeon.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Aren’t we all? When before have you disappeared into an ineluctable dungeon with the face of a god on the floor.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hieronymus takes a flying leap onto Shoemaker’s back and attacks with his Karbunqle staff. He smashes his hand against the kettle-pot after smashing her over the head with his staff. Hieronymus skips out of there, but Shoemaker catches him in the heel with her greataxe.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: So many of you are in robes. It’s hard to tell with the body ends and the robe starts. I don’t wear clothes so it’s difficult to figure out the geometry.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: I plan on wearing your pelt when we kill you.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Be careful my pelt doesn’t wear … you … after you put it on.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Well I’ve always wanted a good hair-shirt.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Definitely don’t take my helmet! It’s just here for decoration. And it even looks stupid!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick [Insight 18] Shoemaker doesn’t want you to take the helmet.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc continues to debate what kind of 12-dimensional kettlepot bear chess Shoemaker is playing.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick intuits that this helmet has something to do with the fire suppression compulsion, and her ability to invoke the soil spirit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez knows that the helmet needs to come off. For no reason.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: “Since the dawn of time, bears have not worn helmets on their heads.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez remembers Ponderous bears, Lugubrious bears, (halflings consider themselves so entertaining that other entities that couldn’t speak common were considered boring); Insipid bears (all from childhood books about bears)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - it is speaking to you, and with the accent of the lead singer of a band, so as a halfling you might even feel a little affiliation with them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Drav shoots a ray of frost that misses Shoemaker, but adorns the vat of earth with some frosty tips.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: Will it take us to Flavortown? [investigation explosion of 2]: Flavortown will commence shortly.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - the raw smell of city earth when construction crews have dug up a sub basement.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick has “put out the fire”, nor is she obsessed with kindling. Flick remembers knocking over Drav and shouting at her&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick [perception 16] can tell there is something odd about the active radius around the vat of earth.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez is slightly spacey to start with, thinking about how clever he is most of the time; he might have sneezed at the melty-flesh vision.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick avoids using planar warrior; throws a hunters mark at Shoemaker. “You made a mistake that’s just the first in a long line of mistakes!”&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I’m here as a warning to you! (Flick shoots her twice; nocks a third arrow)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: “You can fuck off, or we can keep doing this.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I don’t know why you’re so resistant to being helped, as far as your only true powers are concerned.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick narrows her eyes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker turns to Fez: And what did YOU just say? (presumably about flavor town). Frazzled by Flick’s arrows, she’s unable to swing her axe properly. However, she’s close enough to the vase to shake it like a delicate maraca in Fez’s direction. Closer to the epicenter, Fez feels his body start to come unglued, and then snaps back into stability.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc successfully puts together a Snav Snifter (red dragon burp, gremlo’s indigestion? gremlo’s heartburn? bigby’s “i ate too many spicy wings [spicy wings are angel wings torn off in hell and eaten by demons]”), which he finishes and shouts: “Fez, get out of the way!”&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: when you say “Watch out” i can hear that too.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez attacks with whip, hits, runs and hops up on the bar.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: “when i’m not rolling around …”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: “Oh yeah, why don’t you feel a bit warm right now?”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: “No, as a wood elf I know when things are on fire. and i’m not on fire in the middle of a damp dungeon underground.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Haven’t you ever heard of coal-mine fires? In any case, you should still feel guilt about the way you abuse your magic.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: I’m gonna take all your Goodberries after we explode your corpse.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: There’s not a finite supply.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: Then why are you mad about it?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: because you open yourself up to retaliation each time you grab one from elsewhere. You don’t remain safe when you use your portal spells. — no snappy retort, eh?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hieronymus does what he thinks is whisper telepathically to his friends. “Guys, I know this bear’s weakness. If I take her kettle off, her brains will be exposed underneath.” — He takes out his bagpipes and thinks back to the first song he learned in the monastery: the bare bear-plains national anthem. (which is the only song he can play). there’s a heavily orchestrated version ; but hieronymus is playing the hot cross buns learner’s version. he starts to play and looks over to see if Shoemaker is reacting in any way, like taking her helmet off (out of respect)&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- He plays really terribly but realizes that no one else can hear his telepathy; it might be that tapping into the whisper walls is using all his telepathic energy, or nobody heard him (not getting service down here). but he still thinks he’s telepathic. He plays so badly that it angers Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: this is like the sounds of the elks mating in the winter. which i hate. everything else mating, though, i love.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude (shouting) : did i hear that it was damp up there? it is quite wet down here as well; we should consider uniting the spaces in an aquatic park of entertainment. and murder.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: I would love send you to sea world.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: to see which world?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: the world in which you don’t exist.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I feel like that is a logical contradiction. yes they never did teach you logic at the monastery, did they? that’s reserved for those 200 years old or older.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: but i’m like… at least 300.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I thought I was at least 300. But … then why didn’t you ever take logic classes?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: oh that’s right, because we’re twins.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, indeed, we are born of the same mother</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: yes, like all elves at the monastery. don’t you remember when we all hatched at the same time?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: of course; elves hatch from eggs. you made sure you use my hypertrophied fingernails and toenails to chip open the egg for yourself. it’s where my obsession with manicures comes from. i never want to be instrumentalized again. but you have no problem instrumentalizing others.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: i seem to be having a bit of a problem with my instrument. once it’s fixed … things are going to go down.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: did i hear the bare bear-plain national anthem?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: i was, yes</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i must tell you that the bears have overthrown their nationalist ambitions, and since have joined together as a consensus-based democracy of bears.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: well if you know so much, why don’t you come up here and play it yourself?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: is that an invitation which aims to dispel the fact that i have been turned from the doughty cleric up there?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: yeah, it’s like … a detente.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Ok well i will see you shortly.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: i definitely can wait, because i hate you.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: did someone say Snav? he’s well-known around here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick thinks back to Joan, and wonders if she made it back to Marshbout or Cressida.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Drav (Angela has left; through Ian) casts … ? fire bolt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker, a fire-retardant creature, only takes 1/2 damage. -- Perhaps on a ponderous bear that might have worked, but some of us spend our entire lives putting out fires in the woods.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Eldar goes to re-tag Drav to start the game up again, doing a bunch of damage. \"Drav, don’t you remember? we were never supposed to tell your new parents about me. I was one of the reasons that you were forced out of your birth home. doesn’t this ring a bell?\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick reaches out and envelops Shoemaker in an energy field, and tries to explode it in a point. for damage.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - retreats out to table, and then tries a called shot to try to knock the kettle off her head.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- The kettle falls off Shoemaker’s head and clangs against the floor.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I gave you a lot to think about, eh?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez, standing on the bar, gets his legs cut out from under him as Shoemaker rushes up with her great axe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I’m too tired to go back and get my helmet. unrelated, my ass, with its callouses, is the toughest part of my body.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc repositions himself and throws a Snav’s Snifter, which explodes on Shoemaker. Jean-Luc sprints over and picks up the kettle. “Got your stupid helmet motherfucker!”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: you’re right — so you should just leave it where it is. if you’re carrying something stupid that makes you a stupid.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc [intimidation 15] (“what’s the equivalent of giving the bear the middle finger?”) attempts to goad Shoemaker</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - Shoemaker: “I wouldn’t put that on if I were you; but i’m gonna be over there in a second anyway and there’s not much you can do about it”. Jean-Luc pantomimes huge jaw hands like “blah blah blah”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc hears behind him the soft sifting noise of dirt behind him; the vase is erupting with soil and covers his boots and climbs up his body in a mound. he turns into a creature of pure physical flesh; a gelatinous pyramid; as the dirt recedes ; (from the outside he looks normal).&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - afraid for at least 1 minute with a DC 17 Charisma throw.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez heals himself.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I bet you too think that ability to heal yourself comes from nowhere?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: pass. you’re talking nonsense.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: i wanted to have a sophisticated conversation about your belief system. — shoemaker bites Fez, and he doesn’t slip on goo. but her saliva looks like normal saliva, not marjorie’s greenish-white saliva.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: i want to play one of my favorite bear games. i killed a bear when i was only 3. and he takes out darts to shoot them.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: hieronymus, i knew you were a murderer: you’ve been killing bears and bars and elves. and fish.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: well obviously i didn’t kill a bear when i was three; i was still in the egg-womb with you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I was under the impression we counted ages after we hatched. i would rather not have to think about abortions, which are an egg-layer’s right to choose.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: not in Marshbout it’s not.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude (getting frazzled for some reason): well — marshbout is a large place — and — has a diversity of opinions (perhaps she’s been wrestling with her pro-choice views after growing up as a monk)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: we can talk politics later. i’m not exactly sure where you are at the moment.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i’m downstairs; i was just speaking with Eldar. a very very powerful little lady. i’m not sure you know the extent of her hidden powers.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: there is no escape.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: well, i _have_ made my way out of the monastery. or we can see each other in a moment up there?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: no, i have … an appointment.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: oh, and it’s covered? what is it for?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: no, dental is not.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: probably all the rich fatty and sugary urban fare you’ve been eating. if you adhered to the dietary restrictions of the monastery it would just be grasses and natural plants and fruits.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: if you had any sense, you would know that i’m going to get my teeth drilled. because i desire the pain.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: well have you considered dilettantes, because it would be more torturesome?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: but the professional knows exactly where to poke and prod</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i suppose the difficulty is when they get so wrapped up in their technique&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: my dentist is a true maniac. he has no scruples whatsoever.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude. a rare combination indeed. i must offer you all the worst, then.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: if you’ll excuse me, i’m in the middle of a game of darts now</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: by all means, throw the darts as hard as you may into your own extremities, as we play darts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- both of Hiero’s darts hit the bear; — Bear’s eye! and he shoots directly for her eyes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: sometimes it’s important to see what’s hidden, but this really hurts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero kills her very slowly. He hops onto her, and presses the darts deeper and deeper into her brain through her eyes. (thinking he’s using time-manipulating magic) -- everyone else sees him shoot the darts, which go into random parts of her body (shoulder and ribs) but Hiero runs up anyway and smashes her eyes with his open palms. “Time-Manipulating Magic!”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez and Hieronymus [DC 17 charisma check] . Hieronymus also turns into a flesh mound. might actually be one of his dreams as a flagellant, to be nothing but exposed nerves and muscles; unable to move.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Eldar’s creepy whispers to Drav don’t go unnoticed, and Drav shrieks in pain as Eldar reaches out to grab her hand again.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div> - Eldar: If you wouldn’t try to keep me hidden inside of you, I can promise that it wouldn’t be so painful when I emerge. — the putrid rot of drav’s flesh is evident.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Drav disengages and runs back behind Carlos.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick takes the opportunity to shoot at Eldar, this poor little dwarf spirit. Eldar becomes transparent and disappears as she whispers to Drav “don’t allow them to keep suppressed within you what is your greatest power!”&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick tries to shatter the vase with a regular arrow. the arrow pings harmlessly off it, despite its appearing to be made of glass.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Drav: i think it has some kind of magical protection on it. Carlos is my best friend. (Drav and Carlos hug each other). We may need to cast dispel magic on it.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude shouts: Which one is … “shithead” ?</div>"}

A deal with Vek. Fez can't fake it. Cyrowan, the reluctantly silent squire. Up into the sunlight and towards the Big Hedge. Absquatulating with Aphelia? Shut in by Seomra.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Flick’s apology meant quite a lot to me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Vek, do you remember a younger me when you knew Shoemaker.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Shoemaker was more like the curator of a museum with a lot of travelling exhibits. Occasionally we’d get spirits from overseas. There were elves that came through there, sometimes druids; we did get a lot of creatures, hermits, ascetics. As an elf you’re …</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: I’m 75. (So, a young adult)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: I don’t remember you coming into that basement, and I’m fairly sure we’ve not interacted before this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Do you remember (Lupenna’s description) [Bad Persuasion role]</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: I certainly do get a lot of werecreatures ,lycanthropes and things. It’s rumored that I can cure that disease. It takes more than the power I have, because that’s an agreement made with the natural cycles — almost behind the creature’s back. I largely allow people to look inside themselves. I can offer certain remediations to an unwilling shapechanger. It is possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: You may be with us longer than you intend to be.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Just any place outside should do to dump me in! And a glassblower with 50-60 years of training in order to properly break down the vase.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Was this part of the agreement, guys?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Jean-luc: It seems like a thing we’d agree to.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Do you remember when we were trying to liberate Aphelia from Seomra so we could return the music to the Peryton? Where did that end up?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Jean-luc: I’m just along for the ride, baby.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Someone had their abilities sucked out of them? That sounds like precisely what they may have directed you here for. It’s one of my talents to reintegrate the separated flesh and spirit, just as I can separate them.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: What would you need to help us out with this?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: You’re right I don’t do things for free; but as part of the intervention; I could certainly help with Jean-luc’s increasing alcoholism. I don’t know if the whole surprise intervention thing works; he’d have to be a little bit on board.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: I’m not sure that’s a problem that needs solving.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Typically I get to know people so well that I can gain knowledge that is useful to me; it is sufficient , kind of a pay what you will situation. I’m glad to accept donations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick:We’ve gained a spirit therapist with the voice of A’Leh “The Goon” Kihs</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">When Vek speaks, it unintentionally spits bits of soil out of the lidless vase. Flick covers the lid with the mildly sticky fizzlecyst webbing, forgoing the use of a hammock spied in a backroom. Survival and perception checks indicate to Fez and Flick that there could be an entity in the subbasement’s pool. If it hasn’t come up by now it probably won’t. If the door is barred, they should be safe. Flick has lingering anxiety about smoldering wood, and scurries about stamping out any charred pieces of wood.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">[Long Rest commences]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Jean-luc thinks to himself that he enjoys a good drink, and maybe hits the bottle harder than others, but recently he’s started to doubt whether or not he’s a verified alcoholic.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Fez [Wis save] Abzu had mentioned something about the Talleacht; while dreaming, these tall pale humanoid creatures, known from childhood stories describing ghouls or ghasts; look like they have gills and webbing. A nightmare of a few of these creatures wandering up from the sub basement pool (still green pool with algae on top), algae covers them like strands; they make their way up the stairs and come stand before you.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Talleacht. Fez! Why aren’t you coming for us? Why aren’t you saving us?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: I don’t know who you are.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Talleacht: Fez! Seek out the Talleacht. We are the Gormflaith. Why have you abandoned your fellow sailors?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fez startles awake, and they disappear.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance [Con save fail] CON and CHA decrease by three due to the Boils spreading. He wakes up in the middle of the night shivering from a fever; the neuropathy is worse; the boils have started to spread across his body; and he’s having trouble breaking.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I think i know what the problem is. I have to go downstairs and take a dip. I used to swim every day in the icy ponds of Cromfldldor; that’s how I felt my best self; and I haven’t felt my best self since then. I just need a nice refreshing swim, so I’m going to pop down there and do a few laps if you fellas don’t mind.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Well don’t let me stop you.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Before you go some of those boils look pretty — uhf. Do you mind if I put a salve on them?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Well, they do hurt. it’d be nice if you could pop them like a bubble wrap.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: It’s going to burn a little (but it actually burns a lot)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Bring it on, brother.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Fez brings out a primarily alcohol-based salve and then “heals disease.” The boils subside somewhat, and the delicious warm feeling of burning alcohol spreads throughout the wound, and he regains 1 points each of CON and CHA.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Well perhaps I don’t need that swim after all.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: It’s an excellent salve; I made it myself</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Could you give me the recipe?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: I think I remember what it was, but it requires a still and the necessary amount of sailor’s grog.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: That I'm afraid I don’t have. I’d have to ask Jean-luc, our drunkard friend.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: He does know how to put it away, doesn’t he.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I’m not sure he “knows how”</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Jean-luc is over in the corner sleeping soundly. Fez [makes DC 15 wisdom check with nat 20?], while applying the salve, his fingers feel strange and rubbery for a minute, but as he continues to rub it into the gross boils, he explains it to himself as having to do with how disgusting Vengeance’s skin is.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: On second thought, maybe I’ll dip my toe in the water and see how it feels.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance makes his way downstairs, Flick quietly tracking him, while the sounds of a flute issue from the bar. Vengeance plays a horrible screwing racket on his bagpipes. Vengeance makes it to the pool which emits a lurid and noxious green light. The pool is almost 100 feet long, and the room is entirely visible due to the glow. As Vengeance gets down to the pool, he sees, standing 30 feet away, a figure of a teenage boy, wearing a dark green robe over tattered hide armor.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: I’m looking for Sir Master Fezziwig Hornswoggle!</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance plays his mournful nightswimming theme on his bagpipes. [nat 20?] .&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Are you saying he’s dead? Your bagpipe playing conveys so much, even your name!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I was hoping to take a solitary swim, and you’re harshing my buzz, so if you could kind of scram, little boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Yes, I’ve been told I’m always getting in the way of people. Is the body of Lord Fez somewhere that I could still view it?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Since when did he become a lord?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: I’m not sure of his title, but I know that he’s renowned throughout the world?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I think he’s just upstairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: How should I prepare myself to see him? Is he in a casket, or a mausoleum?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I think he’s just having a drink up there in the bar. He’s definitely still alive.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: why were you playing such a sad dirge for him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: That was just for my swimming ritual.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: OHHH! Well can i sidle past you here?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I’ve already changed into my bathing costume made of sharp and spiny hair.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Why do you have the hairs pointing inwards towards yourself?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I sometimes like to do it that way; it provides better insulation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: And what’s going on with your hands? It looks like a dead person’s skin.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: No, that’s just my normal hands…</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be so judgmental. I’ll get out of your way — the water’s quite tepid.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance dips his toe in to discover the water is room temperature.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Little boy, do you know any freezing spells, something to take the water temperature down a bit?</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Cyrowan’s eyes roll back in his head.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: [deep voice] Ye [regular voice] s I do have something like that. What would you like frozen?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Maybe a swimming lane?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: It’s really just a cube this big.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: FINE I’ll just paddle around in circles.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance [Arcana fail] is distracted by a rebar pole in the wall; meanwhile Cyrowan creates a five foot cube of ice just under Vengeance’s feet floating in the pool.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Will this do for you? If you give me a minute or so I could cover more of a line for you?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Ok, here goes.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance puts on his splintery wooden goggles and jumps into the pool. The water chills quickly near to the ice cube; it does get satisfactorily cold within a few minutes. Meanwhile, Cyrowan, making his way up the stairs fitfully, sneaks surreptitious glances back at Vengeance.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Come on in everybody, the water’s terrible?</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance’s voice is so quiet that it doesn’t even reverberate back to him — has his larynx frozen up, as had been his intent? Flick makes it back to the room before Cyrowan. Carlos is praying fervently, and Jean-luc is slumped over the table.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Sorry to wake you up, bud.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Did you make breakfast?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Not yet, but something came out of the radiant pool downstairs and is asking about you. I would bet it’s the same kind of creature as the ones disguised as people from our past. Fez leaps up, grabbing weapons and armor. Without waking the dwarves, Flick moves the upturned table on which Drav and Carlos are sleeping. Flick positions herself behind Fez but in the limits of his aura. Jean-luc is still sleeping behind the bar, as far as possible from the door, in the hammock.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">They see the pale, tow-headed figure, black-eyebrowed, unarmed figure of Cyrowan, in tattered leather armor, poke his head around the door frame.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan (taking a knee and bowing his head in front of Fez): Lord Sir Fezziwig Hornswoggle, it’s such an honor to meet you!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Just call me ‘Sir Fezziwig Hornswoggle’</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Yes, whatever you desire, of course!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: And what is your name?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: My name? It’s hardly worth mentioning. The name of one so lowly as myself …</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Nice to meet you, ‘It’s-Hardly-Worth-Mentioning’</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Oh, sir, quite a wit on you! It’s one of the reasons I’ve sought you out over the land, high low east west top bottom</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: But your name…</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: It’s Cyrowan sir c-y-r-o-w-a-n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: I have very little use for letters</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Oh yes, a lack of need for letters is one of the signs of a great knight, how could I forget?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Why have you sought me out, as great as I am.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: I wish to become your squire. Precisely because of your reputation. I wish to become one who’s skilled in the martial arts like yourself and do wonderful things.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: What skills do you have? Any skills with a sword?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Yes, I can swing a sword capably.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez (tossing him a rapier): Show me what you got. This is a job interview.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: that’s very kind sir but I want more than a job. I want to train with you and be an apprentice! I don’t require any pay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez (to the open room): Is ‘apprentice’ a job?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (hiding): —</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Drav, Carlos, back me up here. Apprentice is a job, right?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: From what I’ve seen, an apprenticeship is more like a station in life rather than a job.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Are the mechanics of getting it similar?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Typically families send someone to a higher-status family. It’s sort of a take it or leave it. The higher status people are always looking for servants, essentially.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: What if I’m … not.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: I guess you have to tell him to piss off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez; Ok, well, scary dirt monster says you have to piss off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Who, sir? I heard that bag talking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: That’s some kind of weird potted plant. I’m not sure of the details. He … came in with a giant bear. He suggests that if I’m not looking for a servant, that you should “piss off”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Please sir I’ll do anything to be your apprentice, doing whatever you bid.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: that does seem like a very useful service. Unfortunately staffing needs … in this economy. And our alcohol budget is going to go through the roof. I’m not sure we have the resources, know-how, elbow-grease.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Sir in fact I provide my own way and even provide for you.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: In that case you’re hired. I teach you how to be great. The first: be luckier. Two: Every morning I will work on sparring with you and teach you how to fight. Three: A vow of silence. All of my apprentices take a vow of silence.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: Yes I’ve heard of this. In fact I think I saw a monk downstairs. He was talking, but … we could still talk during the training? That sounds good to me, sir.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Fez reaches out his hand. He and Cyrowan narrow down the terms of the vow of silence.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: You don’t think I’m weird, do you sir?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Absolutely not.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: I can still write things down?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Yes. And the vow is also an expression of silence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan: So clever sir, I wouldn’t let anyone tell me you’re not the cleverest man on the planet.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Cyrowan begins being silent. Fez, without alerting Cyrowan, uses Divine Sense. He doesn’t detect celestials, fiends, or undead. Flick comes out from behind the table and begins trancing. Downstairs, Vengeance, feeling refreshed, jumps out of the pool and uses the piece of rebar to comb his few strands of hair while viewing his reflection in the pool. “Alright Vengeance, you can do this,” and adopts a karate pose. The laceration on his side splits open at this, bursting boils along the laceration and spreading the diseased tissue outwards from the center. Little piranha-like fish jumps from the pool and gobble up the exploding liquid. A frothy whirlpool appears as they go crazy.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I thought I wanted to freeze, but I guess I needed to BOIL, popping some boils and collecting the liquid in a vial.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">He runs upstairs to show his friends the vial, and asks if they’d wish to go into business opening an apothecary with him.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Hey, the guy from before!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Yes, my squire: he has taken the customary vow of silence. It’s great for building character and absorbing what the world has to offer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: That’s probably for the best — his voice was a little distracting.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: That’s definitely not why he took the vow.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Why was it then? He seemed to really like you.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: I’m trying to be a good teacher — I have to make a personal sacrifice because it’s necessary for the learning process.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Vengeance, did you ever take a vow of silence?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I did take such a vow; however, I did eventually have to break it, mostly because I was screaming so hard during one particularly rigorous tortue sessions, so I figured, screw it, I don't need to keep this up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: So you thought that committing to a vow would prevent you from screaming? It had to be an external reinforcement?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Unfortunately I haven’t been very good at sticking to my decisions, but from now on I’m going to. I’m set on completing my quest.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: We did make quite a breakthrough! You wanted to become an oak tree, I said you had to become a grub first, then you were going to seek out a woman who transformed your beloved into a mule. I know I’m gonna find something in you, and I promise you can find something in me.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: You seem like a really cool spirit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Yeah, me and this little wet dude are pretty cool together. we could be our own little sub-group.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Wet dude</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Yeah, … the Cyrowan guy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Oh I thought you said “Rotrude” and I got wistful.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: You must have had quite the on-again off-again&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Sometimes I think about her and wonder what could have been.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vengeance expresses sympathy for soil being paved over.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: Yeah I used to have a brother: Sek. He could manifest as soil too. That’s what happened to him. Somebody poured him on some farmland, and covered it over. He’s still stuck there to this day. Maybe your dwarf friends could help with that. I haven’t heard from him in millenia.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Vek begins to describe his multi-container claustrophobia, and how he needs to contract out a shaman to de-contain him if he’s contained three times. Then he “goes to the bathroom.”</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">[Long Rest actually completes]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (to Vengeance): Was there a way further into the structure in the pool downstairs?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I didn’t see exits, but I didn’t dive down. I have to imagine that this dungeon goes down infinitely to the depths of hell. It just seems like that kind of place.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Yeah, even just one level down has proven very strange. I was to get back to Seomra and see if we can get Aphelia to come with us.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I’m ready to get out of here as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (to Jean-luc): You ready to go?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Jean-luc: Yeah, thanks for the hammock. (Looks around) Did we pick up a new companion while I was out?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">The rocks that Xanthu had used to block the exit are again crumbled on the floor. In the temple, Slugg and Balgarius are curled up sleeping together. Vengeance, existing the basement, and in combination with the Hairshirt and the ameliorative effects of the pool, the boils have subsided and all that remains is the healing laceration and the boil scars.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: I told you that salve would work.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Allow me to present you with this vial of pus. It’s quite potent.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: Please hand it to my new squire, who keeps all of my noxious boil materials.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Cool, so we’re just going to be going through him now?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Cyrowan nods officiously. Not able to find a bag, he wraps the vial in his tattered clothing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: We’ll find you a bag.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">The group heads back to Seomra and the music room there. Only about a day and a half has passed. Empty leave plates with crumbs and fruits are scattered about; pitcher-plants hold various enticing liquids. Flick walks in, acting like she belongs in the place, but not owns the place, and casually sets Vek’s container on a nearby projection.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (whispering): Vek, can you sense anything “off” about Aphelia. (Pointing out Aphelia)</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick [fails Intimidation] sees a number of the women run up to help her; Vek’s vase is closed so no dirt closes.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Oh, if you can make sure that’s not too close to the edge.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- long silver haired elf: Why are you here? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (pulling out her flute): I feel like Aphelia and I connected yesterday and I wanted to see if she had anything else to teach me.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick remembers that she had been starting to understand or translate Aphelia’s sonic communications. She gives a quick flourish with the flute. Aphelia looks up and over at you. She glances quizzically at the vase. Flick holds out her hand in a placatory manner .</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- FLick (to Vek): She’s who we’re here to see. Does anything seem missing about her?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: There are odd vibrations in this room.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Are they coming from her or someone else?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Eth: oh, YOU! I thought you were already taken care of by the Simurgh.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">“here . time . now . is . preference “ (while disguising as casual noodling) [nat 20]”</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">A smile creeps across her face. She plays deep bass notes, and any hair that hasn’t fallen off by now does so; everyone returns to their original level of hairiness. she gets up and places a hand on Eth’s shoulder. aphelia comes over and adopts a cross-legged style, which flick mirrors. she pushes flick’s flute aside. I explain to her why we’re there and impress upon her the daily horror that the gnolls are living under. I’m not asking her to come with; we’re going to fight the Peryton and bring it back.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Is she willing to entertain that being reintegrated with the Peryton (calliope) would end her existence as she knows it.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Last time she’d said that she had amnesia and couldn’t remember a prior life. But communicating through music she did indicate that she remembered the musical feeling of that time, and that it was something she longed for. (also, all this music stuff … ?)</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (to Vek): could you effect this reunification in the wild?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: I’d have to see the flesh; there’s so much missing here; i don’t know that i’ve ever seen a creature separated from its spirit outside my embrace. but the wild is, to me, just like an interior, except for all that claustrophobia stuff.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Aphelia isn’t making a noise, but she’s putting her hands over her ears and screaming.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Fez: this is kinda out of my element.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Well, nothing to do but forge ahead.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Eth: what are you doing to her? She's very sensitive to vibrations. I don’t know that anyone would like the sounds coming out of that vase. What have you got in there?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: where are you putting me?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Eth: make sure you cinch the bag!</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick puts Vek in the key pocket of the bag of holding.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vek: This is even more restrictive!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Eth: Thank you! Now what are you trying to get from Aphelia? She already said that she would go with you.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: It looks from the outside like we are a band of crazy people and — we are</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Jean-luc: but we mean well?</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Aphelia connects eyes with Cyrowan and touches his lips. Cyrowan mimes being a squire for Fez. (Fez had asked for rabbits, and laughed at Cyrowan when he’d fallen down on the way over).</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Jean-luc remembers a dream in which by putting the kettle on his head he is able to transform into a bear. Was Shoemaker under this spell? But she had stayed a bearlike creature after death. He did not sense anything malevolent during the dream. Vengeance meanwhile traverses the room to the piano, places Rotrude’s handskin on the piano, saying, “Ok, sister, one more time?” and takes out his bagpipe to play. The gloves not animating themselves, Vengeance puts his hands inside and begins to play.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- What are you touching our piano with?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: It’s normal, it’s just me and my dead sister playing a duet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Sister? You’re just holding decaying matter in your hands.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: How dare you!&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the druids grapples the monk to the ground while another grabs his bagpipe.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- What are these things? This is something you’re wearing? Who are you?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Vengeance? is my name? — why are you harassing me like this?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Certainly you can play the piano, but why would you want to make it so disgusting?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: I don’t really have the time to explain this to you, and really you should educate yourself. This seems to be a bit anti-undead. [persuasion 16]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">The druids still look suspicious, but a little calmer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Yeah, we’ve been called that before, and I recognize how that could come off as bigotted. But we still ask that the undead clean up after themselves, the entrails and other body parts that fall off. Seomra has enough to deal with on her own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Let me give you this book, it’s called human Fragility, and we don’t realize the privileges that we have as humans — i’m half-elf, so I can talk about this stuff. There’s a workbook with some exercises you can do.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Is the workbook separate?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: no , that’s something you can mail in for.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Cyrowan shuffles forward with the brochures he and Vengeance had made on their way north. One of the druids looks at it cursorily.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- I think we’re pretty good as far as educating ourselves goes. we have access to most of the knowledge in the known universe.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: It’s this arrogance I’m talking about . You need to know what you don’t know before you know anything.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- I’m going to pity you and borrow your book.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: great, the answers come pre-filled in. other workbooks come blank, but mine are already filled in.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- So the answer key is there, you just want us to do the reading. there’s no grading service?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: no, there is. there’s … you send me some money and then I send you an A.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- And the cert is good for what?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: It’s really a self-betterment thing. the work that you do to earn the money to spend on the book.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Our money is basically this (she pulls out a leave with bones and a worm on it). it’s primarily the leave, but sometimes we put a little spice on our currency. What’s really dangerous is if you try to pull my hair out, without pulling it up.</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick tries to “read the room” in order to see how much distraction is going on. And Vengeance has been employing Qi-Xotic Confusion. Flick’s goal, getting Aphelia out of the room without being seen. So they are so engaged with Vengeance that they can’t move or take actions. Vengeance takes out his three nut shells , “Hey anybody want to play a quick game? It’s really fun,” yanking one of his teeth out and putting it under the shells. Instead of playing, they scream and pack gauze and phellem into his mouth. One of them is trying to get the gloves off his hands without touching them.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Vengeance: Watch yourself!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (whispers to Aphelia): Come with me now!</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">[Mick leaves]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Aphelia resists ineffectually, and with Eth distracted, Flick drags the personified Kiss backwards into the stairwell, promising inwardly to explain everything to her. The stairway begins to collapse on the two fleeing figures [insight 12], and pull back upwards, which seems intentional.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (to Aphelia): Have you ever ‘gone between’ ?</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick grabs her closely and does a dance spin to open the portal and catch both of them. [Arcana 8] . That doesn’t work, so flick grabs her by the waist and dives off the stairway , using her climbing glove to hang onto the end and jerk a vine free that will swing them down to the ground. It goes so well that Flick is even able to manage a flavor-triple-spin and land lightly and gracefully on her feet with Amalia in her off-arm. A few leaves scatter picturesquely.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (whispering): I’m really sorry!</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Aphelia’s nausea appears to worsen. Flick grabs her and pulls her towards the entrance. As they run past some other elves in there , as she made quite an entrance, she sees that Seomra’s door is beginning to close. The doors close before Flick can get there and takes some bludgeoning damage.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: The biggest wound is to my pride!&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Get off of her! (five other elves that have gathered around)</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Upstairs, Eth sees that Aphelia has gone missing. She looks at Jean-Luc, and beneath her the floor opens up and she drops down a slide made of leaves to the floor below. Jean-luc hurries down the stairs.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: I’m very dangerous! But against five, we’ll see!&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">[DM tries to figure out the map system]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">The elves are not wielding weapons.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick (in elvish): Brothers and sisters, I’m glad you can bear witness to the way I saved this young woman from the staircase malfunction. I know you’re very impressed by that. We were going to go on a walk by the Alldrink; if you could back away we’d very much appreciate it. Flick, addressing the elf who called back her unsuspecting companion, Ephlalphl, who (he) has his name embroidered on his leaf toga.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Efphalphl: the tree can clearly see that you’re attempting to make your egress with no good business at hand; you’ve taken this young lady here hostage?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Why would you trust its judgment more than mire?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- The tree has an ability to read intentions; how else could it open paths for you</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: but surely it doesn’t have access to the objective rightness or wrongness of any course of action. . why would you defer to it blindly?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Efphalphl: Well, you know, it _might_, as a possibly immortal vegetal entity. so who knows how close its connection is to true and false. but in any case it can see that one who’s lived here her whole life seems to be in danger.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: I assure you she’s in no danger. i don’t know if you noticed, but i saved her … very impressively I might add.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Ef: is that where you decided to jump off the stairs?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: we were both being prevented from using a slightly less convenient door. I see you’re not going to be any help!&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Dlapholph here! you want me to tell my friends what to do? I feel like that’s commanding another.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: Ok, i’m just going to turn around and find the handle that’s on this door and be on my way.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Flick [Intimidation 17] notices that Aphelia is clinging closer to Flick just because of Flick’s proximity and her confusion. Flick again commits herself to explaining all this to Aphelia later. She glances behind her to see that there are two side entrances which opened when the primary door closed. Flick thinks it would be great if the elves started arguing amongst each other over who has the most authority. “We’re no better than the tyrants we oppose if we detain her,” Flick, in self-righteous haste, imagines she hears. Aphelia gestures at her hands and Flick sees that her dulcimer is no longer there. Flick gives her the flute to play.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">[Initiative is rolled.]</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">- Flick: You have exactly six seconds to let me leave or shit is going to get ugly. I’m not going to pretend that you have any right to keep me here. [Intimidation 16].&nbsp;</p><br><p dir=\"ltr\">Two of the elves back off and join Dalpholf. “She’s got a point, I’m going to let Seomra deal with it.” But two others remain committed to keeping the sketchy Flick from leaving.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cd299809-7fff-d32a-fb85-45573f094c1d\"></span></div>"}

Meanwhile, Curculio approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend Wodden just after he escaped the confines of a magic lake. Curculio believed that playful flowerfolk were known to swarm to the lake's bittersweet magic and, if seen, could serve as guides. Paros worried that Baphomet posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez unhelpfully misheard Baphomet as \"Bear Vomit.\"</p>\n<p>Paros went on to insult human-fox news in front of Curculio, and admitted that sourced his own news from the psychic manifestation of an evil entity known as Veenock. Curculio mentioned another friend of hers, Zadee (a competent [^verb runt], which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous 63-letter alphabet employed by many canids.</p>\n<p>Curculio, took a moment to size up Turtle's gastronomical potential, proceeding to describe her home cuisine of [^schilpad stoofpot]. Fez declared himself \"His Seaness\" -- a necessary ego boost before the kitsune maligned a halfling language orthography for consisting of only \"bowls and sticks.\" Fez was put in mind of Doodril Frogwart's&nbsp;Bowls and Sticks: a Confusing language for a Charming people; an Abecedarium or alphabetical Primer&nbsp;published through Doodle's Toodles, an \"young readers\" imprint of Frogwart's primary publisher. Curculio mentioned Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic in Marshbout, the not-unsuspicious vanguard of a series of similar clinics popping up in the major cities, and the primary distributor of the&nbsp;Secular Ministrations, a copy of which Paros lifted from the Castle Karn library. Drav was able to confirm that Frogwart was not only prolific, but prolithic, as he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals. Paros unsuccessfully attempted to recall the method for extracting malt sugar (maltose) from barley, disappearing into one of his familiar reveries and dreaming about the fancypencils he used at the castle. Out of nowhere, Fez, determined to save the face of his people, declared that \"in our world, flowers are the children's money.\"</p>\n<h4 id=\"theghostinthewoods\">The ghost in the woods</h4>\n<p>Continuing south through the forest, the group came across an innocuous ghost trapped in what appeared to be an ghostly, evolving maze. When Fez approached, he was recognized by the spirit, which resolved into the likeness of of Cpt. Merrigold. Juna revealed that the death of Von Veen released her from her piscine hybrid form; however, before she could arrive at the ultimate destination on her postmortem journey, she was redirected into the limitless maze in which she now found herself. With Baphomet's influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet, allowing one to encase people or spirits in demiplanar mazes, might be siphoning life energy from Juna.</p>\n<p>As Fez retreated into the [^seomra crann] to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav notioned using Turtle as merely a catalyst and seasoning for a \"turtle bath stew.\" Informing Fez of this upon his return, the overconfident halfling opined on the fox fur stew so favored by halfling-kind. Curculio slashed Fez across the face for this insult, interjecting that her mother had died in the Foxpelt Wars, but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words \"hasty\" and \"tasty\" before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was \"an hour and 50 miles.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"tusternoof\">Tusternoof</h3>\n<p>At that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn open as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as \"Tusternoof\" or \"The twisted one,\" it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian land husbandry, The twisted one provided a possible clue to locating the mirror lake. Paros, realizing the unmined potential of Tusternoof's knowledge, sank deep into its mind as Fez found himself sucked into a mindmaze. Tusternoof unwittingly revealed the 'org chart' of Baphomet's followers (of which he confirmed himself a boon'd lieutenant), including a shadowy cult of [^urush mekh] handling intricate metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy.</p>\n<p>Fez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Drav and Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with well-placed blobs of pure elemental energy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"flowerfolk\">Flowerfolk</h4>\n<p>With the monster dead, the forest sprang to life, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk (or&nbsp;bloemenwet) in a nearby tree. The creature, named Ashtai, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk. Using Ashtai as a signal booster, Paros harness his bracer to telepathically premonish the bloemenwet on the Slubber, receiving in return nothing but visions of holocaust. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading the minutes of a colloquendo conducted by dwarven geomancers: they had discussed an ancient earth spirit, Mogesh, which was reputed to guard and protect the Slubber. Drav suggested that perhaps Mogesh could be convinced to extend its aegis to the bloemenwet.</p>\n<p>The group pondered what step to take next.</p>\n<p>[^verb runt] stenographer; amanuensis; scribe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/pr\" title=\"show-mrah crown\">^seomra crann</a>: bathroom; lit. \"tree room\" in halfling [^schilpad stoofpot] turtle-and-rosepetal stew made customarily from auroch-bladder-sized turtles found in seaside collections of nearly frictionless stones sliding back and forth with the tide along thin trenches [^urush mekh] whatever dang creature Tusternoof is</p>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>all just defeated kolmy thaz being talked into returning to village by flick</p>\n<p>Curculio message brought to me by raven ; one of the clues might indicate that might friend might be somwhere around here. they had mentioned something about a lake. after they had been trapped in this area by a lake they couldn’t get out of. wodden (friend) somehow managed to break the spell and get out of the vicinity. and i heard there is a lake nearby like that. it moves around and it difficult to locate. if you know the area well we might be able to</p>\n<p>fez intrigued by idea of a body of water that’s not always in the same place. rides over on Turtle.</p>\n<p>curculio: riding or eating: fez: mostly riding; it does eat things tho</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the turtle will bite or eat, but won’t be bitten or eaten C: the ones we ate looked like big beach balls. only nominally turtles fez: ball-based C: discovered them near rocks rounded by action of ocean; slide around almost frictionlesssly in trenches. you do have a bit of the sea to you. fez is “his sea-ness”; john sea-nuh</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p>halfling is a language, and written infrequently, and fez speaks it dm: language is just the bottom half of the alphabet “bowls and sticks: a confusing language for a charming people; an abecedarium or alphabetical primer” published by doodle’s toodle’s Doodril Frogwart’s juvenile imprint. has these suspicious clinics that pop up .

With vampires about, though, the dead are never truly dead, and within moments a shade in the form of Domonkos had arisen from Mogh's corpse and made its way towards the platform on which the vampire remained tied. Anxious for some action, Joan grabbed a leg of the chair supporting Domonkos and pulled him onto the ground, whereupon the vampire, released from his bonds, crushed Ecks, the homunculus, and inhaled the aerosolized dust and the plasmic ghost. In that moment he put on like a coat his ancient power and declared his intent to make haste to Castle Karn. The woozy Kulgmark dwarves troddled back to their deepsome kingdom, and Domonkos roused a dormant glyph on an obscured portion of the back wall, opening up a secret tunnel.

Exuviae thought she saw a true convert in Fez, but upon anointing him with holy chrism (chunky style) the thriste<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/8#fn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;halfling resisted the compulsion to wrestle naked in honor of the leprechaunic horse. Exuviae admitted that she enjoyed being a member of the bourgeois-leisure class insofar as she was able to provide a similar service&nbsp;gratis&nbsp;to interested members of the burgher demographic. She then turned a scatological imprecation into a confession, revealing that the ring of realistic genital molds kept her trapped in this ring. Carlos attempted to sell out Jean-Luc's jewels (or their negative image), before agreeing with Flick's idea to destroy the integrity of the procreant<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/8#fn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;ring, a task to which they committed themselves once assured of Scrobs's neutrality by the wacky equine. Scrobs, despite the detente, remained a chip off the old block, and danced around the wood elf provocatively in hopes of eliciting a wrestling match.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smashandstab\">smash and stab</h2>\n<p>Drav, cautious of the possibly toxic genital dust pluming from Carlos's maddened swings, drew into herself, and recalled learning that rituals with similar terrestrial geometry, in the absence of a transcendental power, typically conjured their objects in pairs according to the most powerful axis of polarization: in this case, good and evil (or so she thought). Paros, spaced out for reasons altogether unrelated to his proximal physical environment recalled an ecological text which contended that the natural products of certain ancient worms had the tendency to appear differently to surface dwellers. Drav's suspicions aroused, she began further examining the rocks, and quickly determined that the igneous layer was a mere shell over a viscous brown substance.</p>\n<p>As Flick went to inform everyone of the 'planar anomalies' caused by boggle teleportations, the image of Daealla appeared to her through a Scrobs puddle and enjoined Flick to cease destroying the protective genital ring. As Flick remained unable to tear Daealla from the mirror world for a tete-a-tete, and Drav considered the implications of ancient earth-moving entities, Fez noticed that Exuviae had become transfixed by Daealla's genitals, transformed into a shining vector of pure radiant light visible in the nearest puddle.</p>\n<p>Stuck in this stalemate, Daealla confessed that the peryton raiding the gnolls had once been a fey succubus named Calliope, whose draining Kiss had been extracted into a literal and symbolic daughter named Aphelia to reduce the number of enucleated men pledging themselves to the ancient horrors. Attending to the matters at hand, the gang took a moment to catch their collective breath and then precipitously lit all the collected genitals on fire in one of the oil pits, occasioning the transformation of one of the larger rock benches into the malicious form of Gedhtathgon, a totally metal black knight, at whose beck and call Exuviae transformed into Hengest the Violent, the Neightmare of renown.</p>\n<hr />\n<section><ol><li id=\"fn1\"><p>Bold, daring; audacious, presumptuous.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/8#fnref1\">↩︎</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2\"><div>Of, relating to, or enabling procreation.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/8#fnref2\">↩︎</a></div></li></ol><h1>Transcript</h1><p>flick: unimpressive \"acrobatics\" to waddle between the rocks.</p><p>orange, but purple veins in it the color of scrobs' body. dc-18 strenght saving throw or be restrained (oh, scrob's restraint puddle)</p><p>exuviae does cream-cheese oil all over fez (i give him advantage because he's protected from good and evil) -- but also it's a charm spell and he's immune to charm</p><ul><li><p>fez still covered in oil</p></li><li><p>fez tries to make it seem like it's not the grossest thing ever.</p></li><li><p>exuviae: you like it! is this part of your normal morning routine.</p><ul><li>sect of halflings somewhere that does this to themselves.</li></ul></li><li><p>performed \"Traditional halfling ablutions\" on you -- for nothing. how's that a waste?</p></li><li><p>exuviae gets others to do things for it, and likes being a member of the leisure class</p><ul><li>misses hoof attack on fez</li></ul></li><li><p>flick: fuck you!</p></li><li><p>exuviae: if would make it easier to fuck me with a copy of your genitals</p><ul><li>it's the main reason i'm trapped here.</li><li>druids try to keep themselves in wrestling salad days.</li></ul></li><li><p>flick insight[20] -- not lying about being trapped here. when it's on this plane, it has to come to this area.

Fez refutes Abzû. Amalia, unturned, is killed. Rotrude gives the gift of boils and her handskin. Vek makes a plea for its life. Jean-luc finally gets a star.</div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div>Jean-luc, operating under the impression that he is an unmoving puddle of flesh, attempts to gather himself up again using his own dissolving form. Through his lo-res eyespots he is able to locate himself vaguely in the room; occupying the site of the soil on the bar table is a nebulous swirling cloud of dirt and starlight mineral sparkles.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: You have a lot of anxiety. Perhaps just relax into your new form. Why are you resisting this after just having invoked my powers?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This rumbling spirit voice can be heard only by Jean-luc and Hieronymus. Hieronymus goes to pour his liquid self into the vase to become one with the spirit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, you are already quite of the flesh. I can tell that you, Hieronymus, know the relationship that transpires here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc thinks that the process can be interrupted if he lets the spirit know what is actually going on. More panicked than anything, he attempts to move towards the bar. The intense training he's done over the years is not available to him, and he only slides about ten feet forwards. It feels to him as though he's rolling a fleshball.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: You won't be able to take advantage of what I have to offer if you resist like this.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I'm kind of a fan of having bones.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Why did you even come here, then?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: It's a long story. I'm just along for the ride. You may have gotten the wrong idea. I ... didn't mean to offer myself.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Have no doubt you will get your bones back. I can see that already you are intellectualizing this experience, whereas the point is to retreat into yourself, and 'lose' your bones.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Who would seek out such an experience?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I can hear your friend, but I cannot talk to her unless she becomes one with my network.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: That's a hard pass.</div>\n<div>- Vek: One more step closer and I can offer that to her.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez, experiencing a lot of new things with his friends around, goes to push over the vase, [Athletics 12], really putting his \"fish-man\" scale-mailed shoulder into it. As he does so, the room rotates around him, the vase, and the table (on a horizontal axis) in the opposite direction that he's pushing. Flick sees that Fez is falling backwards to the floor after initially touching the vase. Fez, desirous of resetting the room, stops pushing the vase and comes to, prone on the ground. Fez notices that his carrying bag is beginning to undulate gently. Upon looking inside, he sees that the conch shell found on the sand after the shipwreck of the Majestic Elk is overflowing with dirt, and that thick green (in between nature and evil) tentacles are emerging from the dirt, like a hermit crab's claws. He takes the conch from the top and places it on the ground.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Abzu: Fez, come to collect on our pact, have you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: New phone, who dis.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: My name is Abzu; it's \"short\" for Adzub. It is likely that your weak half human frame was too discombobulated at the time the pact was made to remember the finer details.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A rapid-fire clarification of the orthography of the creature's name takes place. Suddenly, the inimitable voice seems to trigger a memory in Fez. ... is it a boomerang? No. It's a \"memory boomerang\" from the sea. As the Majestic Elk was destroyed, and he was dragged under the surface of the ocean, the cries of the sailors of \"Kraken!\" reverberated in his mind, and he found himself wrapped in massive, thick tentacles. His eyes regained focus to find himself staring into huge expressionless eyes, churning like a hurricane. For one of the few times in his life, his self-confidence and ego were subsumed beneath a desperate plea for his life. (This couldn't be right, Fez thinks. I'd never do that.) In the memory, Abzu, for that was the kraken, let him live, as long as he committed to a pact: when it was requested, he would act in service of the beast. Some time later he found himself cast up onto the shore with the conch.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez remembers seeing it. The fact that he wasn't confident at the time couldn't be right, but it does seem like it happened to him. Unable to process something like this, he tries to turn away from the months of depression he thought might ensue.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Abzu: There's no need to be depressed. The power I'm willing to give you will compensate for any transient emotional distress.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: It doesn't sound like a great deal, and it conflicts with my visions of more benevolent sea monsters.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: What is there about me that's not benevolent?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Your creepy voice, your tentacles, and the destruction of a ship.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Well that ship was in my waters -- and many of those aboard were enemies of the Krakens.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Why?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: They are a coastal people and have animosity towards those who wish to share the sea with them.</div>\n<div>- Fez: It doesn't seem like you're sharing the sea with them at all -- you were the aggressor.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: After they demonstrated they were xenophobic, I decided to trade them an eye for an eye.</div>\n<div>- Fez: So the things people did to you, you did back to them. That's not benevolent.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: I protect the sea creatures.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What do you eat?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Algae.</div>\n<div>- Fez: You sure?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: That's it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez is pretty sure that algae and plankton go towards its diet.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Abzu: The blue whale is even larger than I am, and it's sustained on krill.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah but it's a mammal.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Right, so its metabolism is even higher.</div>\n<div>- Fez: So you're saying it's worse than you?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Is a tortoise worse than a mouse?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yes.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: You were only recently riding on a turtle.</div>\n<div>- Fez: How do you know that?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: You made a pact with me!</div>\n<div>- Fez: That doesn't sound right. Can you show me where I signed?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: It's not my fault that mortal memory is so easily destroyed.</div>\n<div>- Fez: None of this adds up correctly.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Fine, if you don't believe me, the next time you go to swipe at one of these many enemies -- attend to what occurs, and it will be clear that I provide your power to you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Even if that's true, what were the terms of the pact?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: When I need you, you will be there to serve me. A war is brewing, and even these minor excursions by the Teallacht could be dissuaded with your involvement.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Why are you talking to me now?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Something about the way you lost life after we made our pact rendered our continued conversations impossible. Through the influence of Vek, you are reduced to what is fundamental about your body, and that has allowed me to talk to you again.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Can we return to our previous relationship? Where you shut the fuck up and I go on my way?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: If you wish</div>\n<div>- Fez: Great -- so be it. And a reminder that this is the first pact I've made with you.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A discussion of bags, shells, and halfling racism ensues as Fez and Abzu attempt to hang up on one another.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: Yeah -- our adventuring team only has one famous hobbit!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>(From the outside room)</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos!!</div>\n<div>- Flick: What the fuck was that?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>With Flick's superior elven hearing she can determine that Amalia is still quite far down the hallway. Hieronymus meanwhile slides into Vek's DMs in an attempt to pour himself into the vase.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Yes, spirit, let us commune. Let me absorb your nutrients and grow into the mighty oak that I have always longed to be.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Before you become the oak, you must become a grub.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: I thought if anything I'd have to become an acorn first.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Acorns are much tougher and resilient than those who come to me wish to be. But you may crawl towards me slowly, little grub.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Uh..... ok!</div>\n<div>- Vek: When you mortify yourself, do you know about the energy that ... flows through the universe.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: ... what? Yes, I know all about that. Am I not talking to myself?</div>\n<div>- Vek: This is Vek. Victor. Echo. Karate.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Well, Mr. Vik, I agree, I'd like to become part of you. May we commune in a beautiful fusion of flesh and soil?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, I'm glad I don't have to convince you like I do Jean-luc.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Yes, he's just an old fuddy-duddy who never wants to do anything fun.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc (nodding): Yeah, both of you enjoy your blood orgy.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez [Con 5], hearing Vek's low-decibel, extra-low-frequency whispers, hurls chunks all over the place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: I quite like this \"Not having any bones\" thing. Bones, as it turns out, were an unnecessary luxury. Life is a lot simpler this way. I can't wait to harvest this divine energy so I become even more powerful.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: The way to the divine energy is to let go of your bones. To become nothing but flesh.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: So, mission accomplished!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus then passes out. Void. Small elven boy. Equally as weird looking. At the horizon of his tunnel his parents are fishing. Instead of physical forms he sees their ki. But looking down at himself he just sees his body: the body of a child. His parents turn to look back at him; as they do he feels an intense, direct hostility coming from them. Then they are yanked out of his vision, and he's left there with no one to protect him.&nbsp;</div>\n<div> - Kid Hiero: Mommy, daddy! Why are you gone before I got a chance to tip your boat over and drown you?!</div>\n<div> - Mom: Heiro, you were always such a rascal. We don't know where you got it from, but it's too much for us, and we're done with you.</div>\n<div> - Kid Hiero: Ohh. Where will I find my ki now? My ky. The key to my existence.</div>\n<div> - Mom: If only you would stop looking -- perhaps then, it will emerge from within you, rather than always stay out of your grasp.</div>\n<div> - Kid Hiero: Stop looking, you say.</div>\n<div> - Mom: Indeed.</div>\n<div>The sky appears to wink, and Kid Heiro takes a whittled wooden dagger and stabs them into his eyes, just like the darts into Shoemaker Byte's eyes. As he does that, he suddenly sees, even eyeless, the pure representation of ki across the night sky. He then wakes up, on the floor of the bar.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: All has been revealed to me. From this day forward, I shall have a new name: VENGEANCE.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Everyone doooooes experience it differently.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Maybe we need to overload the dirt with non-dirt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Curse this backwards! Curse your curse nuts!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos calls down the divine energy of Aulë to rend the vase apart, but the vase merely jiggles excitedly and settles back on the table.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Carlos: My Hammer! Shatter this perverted symbol of vulgarity!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The hammer courses towards the glass container and smashes against it. A crack running from base to rim forms, and soil begins to drain out of the vase. Jean-luc for a brief moment senses his cool sturdy bones. He rises to his feet, throwing off the hallucination like a blanket, confident in his sprightly frame. He grabs the kettle and goes to wing it at the vase.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I can finally come up there! Perhaps we can make our way to your dental appointment together.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I am a changed man, now. I wish to make up with you and go fishing and huckleberry'ing as we once did.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Don't be a simp, Heironymus!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: That sounds wonderful. Perhaps this time we might bring a chaperone in case one of us needs resuscitation.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well, we're adults. I think we can handle ourselves.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I certainly believe that you can handle yourself, but I think I might need assistance. I don't know if you were able to drag me from the depths as quickly as I'd like.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I'm kind of like ... the most powerful person in the world now. I don't have time to explain.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Have you been off on one of your meditative journeys again? And what is this fascinating energy coming from the room you're in.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: That is the dirt spirit.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Well I will be right up, and perhaps we do find a chaperone.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well, Jean-luc here looks up to me as a mentor and is a good friend, and might fit the bill.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I do not look up to you as a mentor, you crazy asshole!</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well then Jean-luc perhaps you would like to be the first to jump into the swirling dirt here.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Your friend sounds audibly disgusted! There is quite a lot of dry-heaving coming from that room.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick, encouraged by the crack in the vase, leaps ten feet towards the table on which it rests. She sees Rotrude, dressed in simple blacks and greys and dripping with brackish water, through the open door. She fires a force-arrow at it, but it wraps around the vase like light bending in water. Forgoing a sharpshoot opportunity, she looses a regular arrow, quickly retreating out of the proximity of the vase. Fez, having had a moment to strategize, lashes his whip towards the vase in the hopes of dragging it off the table; the heavy vase smashes against the floor, the lid smashing but the vase remaining upright, still spilling dirt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: There's no need to destroy me. I was only being invited into your minds by Shoemaker. People usually come to me of their own volition.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez recognizes the possible truth of this plea.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Fez: If you want \"Live and let live,\" can you ... go dormant? And we can just leave you?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I wouldn't mind if you deposited my soil in a local ... heap ... of soil.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I, Fezziwig Hornswoggle, (making the 2nd pact of my life) --</div>\n<div>- Abzu: &lt;Would you like to renew our pact?&gt;</div>\n<div>- Fez: No!</div>\n<div>- Vek: Was that a benevolent kraken talking to you?</div>\n<div>- Fez: It was a non-benevolent kraken.</div>\n<div>- Vek: I know of no such thing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: You're literally dirt.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Dirt is only the vessel through which I can become manifest.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Then how do you know about water creatures?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I don't understand the question.</div>\n<div>- Fez: You retreat your presence into your soil; we will take you out to an inviting spot and deposit you there.</div>\n<div>- Flick (embarrassed at having missed a stationary pot): I agree wholeheartedly</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I agree as well, as long as you allow me to become the seed I have always wanted to be, and implant myself into the soil so that I may become a mighty oak.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Anything that lets me keep my bones is ok with me.</div>\n<div>- Vek: The bones always come back after a time.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Not good enough.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Heiro, since when have you taken such an interest in plant-life. I thought you were more of a poison guy.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well yes, poison comes from plants. When I was a boy, all I ever wanted to be was a tree.</div>\n<div>- Vek: This is fascinating. and you were aware of this before today's visions?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Yes, I was. But now -- I have a renewed purpose. Like when you come back from a year abroad. I know now that I cannot simply be a tree (altho I would like to try that at some point). I have to find the sorceress and give her a good wallop after I am powerful enough to do so.</div>\n<div>- Vek: As a plea for my continued accompaniment, if you look inwards towards yourself you will see that our interaction has renewed your connection with Ki. [Heiro recovers 6 ki points.]</div>\n<div>- Fez: If I wanted to dispose of a seashell and have it decompose in the dirt. And the malevolent presence inside it.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, it could work. There is a risk that it could escape from the physical constraint. A pretty high risk. I don't like to overestimate my skills.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Is it like a minimal effort for you? Or you and Hieronymus could co-exist with that power.</div>\n<div>- Vek: If it's a shell, I'm not sure I would be up to the task. It's hard to convince a shell to return to its fleshy blob state.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What about a kraken?</div>\n<div>- Vek: A little tadpole kraken?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah ... he fits in this shell.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Then possibly.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Well what if it happens to be a small version of a larger kraken.</div>\n<div>- Vek: I am good at suppressing spirits if they can be isolated from their physical forms. It's rare for krakens to be spirits, though.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Can they communicate at a distance?</div>\n<div>- Vek: If you made a pact with them. The Quacken.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm not typically in the business of not honoring my pacts, so I'll just keep it.</div>\n<div>- Vek: You're the kind of guy who, no matter what he's doing, _thinks_ he's honoring a pact.</div>\n<div>- Fez: That is deeply true. Because of tautology.</div>\n<div>- Vek: This explains a lot, really.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Are you and Hieronymus going to become a tree together?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Hieronymus may have misunderstood what the soil component of me is for.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: All I wanted was to soil myself. I don't understand why that's so hard</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: We can soil one another together once I get up there!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I know I said we could be friends again, but that was a passing mood, so I don't want to see you.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: So you want a 'two-hurls-one-monk' situation?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: No. No.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Why not? If you don't desire me, what do you wish for?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I can take care of it. Just please retreat to your dungeons or your catacombs, wherever you came from. [Fails a persuasion check]</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Oh, I can tell you're just kidding. I'll be right up.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc moves as far as he can from Vek and upturns a bottle of disgusting, yet effective, hard spirits. The liquid is quite murky. Fez notices that one of his whip tassles is poking out of Vek's soil, and he goes to wiggle it free, but comes up with just a root.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: I do love a good head massage. Whatever you want to call it.</div>\n<div>- Fez: My apologies.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, you are coming to know yourself through my intervention.</div>\n<div>- Fez: NOW who's overly confident?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I'm a spirit. I'm allowed to be.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez and Vek discuss the notion of an entity's right to be overconfident. Turns out, The Best The First Halfling said \"Freedom is a right of all living beings.\" Fez agrees to 'companion' his friends to help Vek back onto the table. Amalia runs into the room, past the dissipated vapors of Eldar.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos, I can't be held responsible for what I'm about to do after you abandoned me in that cave-in only to come in here for a drink. ... Like I said, no one could blame me for not being able to hit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Amalia hits him with a crossbow bolt which retains a tenebrous tether to her, which throbs with stolen life energy.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Amalia: I'll take from you the life that you denied to me!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Do I hear the pitter-patter of my dear Hiero's feet.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I just want to live my life, MAN!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Displacing his anger onto this new arrival, Hieronymus batters Amalia with his Karbunqlestaph. Hieronymus slides down his staff, sliced by the protruding thorns and lubricating it with blood. While being drained, Carlos, not his usual self, wiffs with his battleaxe and coughs unhelpfully. Then Rotrude comes in!&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: We can finally tussle like we're used to. Just get those little hammy fists up, let me see what we can do!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Hammy?&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>With her jagged, shredded nails she claws into Hieronymus, and where she slashes the monk his skin begins to bubble with blueish blisters, and a mild neuropathy settles into his limbs.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I hope you like this bit of torture I've devised. It allows for a bit more pain during our sparring.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: A touch of hurt, you say?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hiero squeezes a boil and a thick, blue liquid jets out and into Rotrude's eye, which immediately swells and takes on the cast of one of the boils themselves.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What have you done? This isn't what I agreed to!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I'm sorry but it seems as though you broke the rules, and the gloves are off.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: How interesting that you should say that!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Rotrude pulls off the skin of her hands up to the elbows, like gloves.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: A duel it is, then!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick, worried about Carlos and attempting to suppress the revulsion at what she witnessed with Rotrude, closes to within two rods, shatters the very fabric of Amalia's being, and then shoots an arrow into Rotrude.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Is this part of the new techniques you mentioned?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Stay still while I make a portrait of you!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: You should use some fluid from the boils on your arm!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc skips into the fray and delivers another deep wound.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Distance fighters look to be your main companions now?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: These are my followers; they haven't learned how to fight yet.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc and Flick: Don't lump us in with him!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Given the distance between all of you: we already have a strong friendship foundation; yet you all treat each other as the same pole on a magnet.</div>\n<div>- Fez (after a long delay): what's a magnet?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What about the concept of magnetism?</div>\n<div>- Fez: What? The compass points the direction. North.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez then \"applies\" a whipping.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I thought you said you were going to give me a solid whipping, not a one-and-done.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I genuinely thought you couldn't take another hit and felt pity for you.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I doubt that this human frame can withstand much more. In the monastery we are taught many ways to consider the human form.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah, well, to me, you look like an undead horror show.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus, utterly fed up, tears the undead monk to pieces.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Perhaps we shall meet again.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, we will always be twins, circling one another, like two halves of a symbolon.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I'm not sure I would go that far.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Would you go to the ends of the earth for me?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Well, that's not that far.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, the monastery taught us we live on a very very small, two-dimensional planet. Goodbye my hairy mouse!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Goodbye my lovely serpent sister.</div>\n<div>- Flick (After a beat): Enough of that pervert shit.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The gang listens intently for footsteps; Fez, glancing around the room, casts his eyes over Shoemaker, her greataxe, the skin of Rotrude's de-gloved hands. Flick dances sprightly over to Carlos and tries to draw any evil out of him and into the void.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Carlos: I think I just need to sleep for a long time -- regain my ruddy dwarven complexion -- and this will all go away like a bad dream.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick hands him a goodberry, and he chokes it down despite his nausea and Shoemaker's warnings. The wood elf then trips over to Shoemaker's body, determining for good that she's a bear only with opposable thumbs and the ability to walk upright with ease. Flick remembers that ordinary folks think of these things as ursothropes, but there doesn't appear to be any shapechanging going on, as such creatures are supposed to return to their \"default\" state at death.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick: What am I supposed to make of this!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>She's not a werecreature, and this is probably just her species, a kind of permanently hybrid species. [Int 1] She is from an ancient line of humans, from which druids \"evolved.\" Flick picks up 39 uncrushed goodberries which dropped out of Shoemaker's paws upon her earlier entrance. They are vines, like grapes -- not like the individual and separate berries she typically receives; they clearly grow somewhere, which she would never have guessed before. The one rotten goodberry that appeared at Castle Karn had really freaked her out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Flick (mumbling to herself): Yes, the humans I know _are_ pretty hairy. I don't want to skin a sapient creature.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Her hand briefly touches some of the soil.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Vek: The berries, they grow around Shoemaker's house.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Sorry about trying to break your vase. Sorry about that.</div>\n<div>- Vek: That means a lot.</div>\n<div>- Flick: How did you get here? I had always heard that she lived near where I grew up. Did you take some kind of portal here?</div>\n<div>- Vek: My jar is in Shoemaker's basement. I'm not just waiting in there, though. People have to come by and invoke me. I'm always popping up all over the place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: so Shoemaker summoned you once she had tracked me down. If we were to scatter your soil, you'd be able to unbind and return whence you came.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Unbinding isn't a problem but I don't like to have unnecessary duplicates of myself hanging around.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick finagles the vase into the bag of holding, while Jean-luc notices that the kettle radiates indeterminate magic.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Carlos: Aule seems to think this is more druid magic rather than anything arcane.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Hey, I bet I know what that thing does. You take crabs, and boil them -- then the shells go all soft and you can get into the meat.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I do enjoy a good seafood feast.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc grabs some clarified alcohol in a distinctive bottle bearing a silver eight-pointed star etched into the bottle. Hiero goes over to Jean-luc, puts a chair behind him.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Hiero: Jean-luc, why don't you sit down for a second, there's something we have to talk about. [Jean-luc remains standing] I know that you think we came down here to fight some undead creatures, but actually this is an intervention. I'd like you to give me your bottles; i'll keep them safe. To make headway we need you at 100%, and you weren't really all that much help in the last bottle.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-luc walks away stoically.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>- Heiro: Suit yourself. If you ever want to talk, I'll be here.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick throws the departing rogue a goodberry. After eating the berry, Jean-luc's desire for drinking increases. Poking around behind the bar, he finds 70 gold in the till. Jean-luc, not looking to take money from a hardworking establishment underground in a creepy temple, leaves the gold. But, lying right in his line of sight, he sees a star matching the one on the bottle exactly, and he pockets it.</div>\n<div></div>"}

Remy’s thaumaturge Snav, after inspecting the artifact, grotesquely directed her to one ‘Lupenna’ near the town of Marshbout. Remy, though annoyed by Flick’s importunity, dispatched Joan — travelling to Marshbout on her own assignment — as a chaperone.</p>\n<p>They both made their way south without issue until their passage over a stone bridge was impeded by a deceptively adorable bearcublike creature sporting a single spiral horn on its forehead. Joan’s attempts to platonically embrace the creature were misinterpreted as aggression, and she allowed herself to be flung to the side so as to spare it any embarrassment. Flick, evincing her trademark uncircumspect insistency, presented the creature with her onyx figurine. The Zorbo, upon touching the object, began to take on its material attributes (for such, as they surmised, is the way of Zorbon), only to be afflicted by something far more powerful, and collapsed. They administered to the cub as best they were able, but only time and physical contact with its fieldstone home could help the cutie, so they proceeded apace to Marshbout.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Drav, a dwarf wizard raised by elves in Forest Ogrelodge, adventured westward to discover kindred dwarven communities. At the foothills of the Steeple Peak Mountains, she was introduced to Carlos the Dwarf, a cleric about to travel to Marshbout to donate his healing expertise to the beleaguered community there.</p>\n<p>They were offered a ride by the stormless cloud giant Rufus Skyflume. After a day in his makeshift wagon surrounded by longhaired cloud cattle and a shorthaired favorite named Priscilla, they parted ways at Balach Pass when Rufus headed north to visit a family member. What should have been a half-a-day’s march to town elongated somewhat when they passed by Mirror Lake, whose strange magic required that they swap some possessions before escaping its spatio-temporal loop. They arrived in Marshbout later that afternoon, and, while making their way to the Perch Office to send messenger owls with letters of safe arrival to their families, Drav sighted an enormous cat. When they inquired of the loquacious Perchmaster General as to any events or conditions requiring clerical ministration, he mentioned a few instances of exploding bodies and zombified cats, but could not comment as to the ‘pig-sized’ feline of Drav’s report. He was able to point them towards Norman Barrelchest, one of the town’s constables (in charge of the armamentarium and responsible for ensuring the safety of the nearby highways).</p>\n<p><strong>— Swaddlington P.

Flick continues towards the rest of the group on the far side near the remaining rubble. Jean-Luc sees a regular wooden door which looks out of place in this stone tunnel. As he inspects it, he can see light coming from underneath. [wis 4] Intrigued, the plausibly dashing rogue incautiously shoulders open the thick door and walks in. Since fleeing from Kriopolis after \"getting involved with the wrong woman\" and, more recently, being adopted by a rag-tag collection of Goop Snoopers, this little bit of apparent city life calls out to Jean-Luc warmly. Inside, a small dive bar greets him, empty of occupants except for a single beautiful woman profiled against the ambient light, nursing a beer. She sports close-cropped dark-green hair, a tiny nose that looks slightly broken and wears a well-fitting doublet and trousers set off by a bright white fizzlesilk ascot tied loosely about her neck. [insight 12] He knows her instantly: Marjorie. The honeypot. He'd bought drinks for her all night at The Shady Sill until, upon going to pay, discovered his purse has been sliced and the contents removed by, presumably, thieves. Calling out the bartender for providing an unsafe drinking environment had gotten him nowhere. Marjorie had offered to settle everything, but instead somehow indebted him to the Gaol Maidens, a crime ring centered on Kriopolis but with cells all over Albland.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Seeing her here is a relief, although admittedly a freak chance, after bivouacking through the wilderness for days and receiving skin treatments even more dubious than ones he'd had to pass off on unsuspecting tourists (he'd started pretty low on the career ladder with the Maidens). This slice of familiarity feels just right.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Out of the corner of her ear, Flick, hearing Jean-Luc's footfalls turn off to the right, glances back to see the open door and a mildly sickening greenish-yellow light spilling from the room. A \"Hey, friend, you alright?\" gives Jean-Luc a slight pause as to the advisability of this detour, but he successfully compartmentalizes the warning and approaches Marjorie.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: Oh Jean-Luc, I also never thought I'd see you again.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: If I recall correctly, I believe you owe me a drink</div>\n<div>Marjorie: How do you figure?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well the last drink was on me and it ended up costing me my entire money purse.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I thought we'd discovered that was a rowdy bar patron who'd taken advantage of you. (She winks)</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc laughs: I suppose we should let bygones be bygones. A round, barkeep!</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I think you've already got one.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc looks down to see that, indeed, a beer is waiting for him on the counter. Meanwhile, Flick, weirded out, gets into a squat, grunts, and bears down: a sign to the others that she's casting her 'horizonal gaze' towards potential fiends or monstrosities within five miles. But she doesn't sense any nearby. Jean-Luc [nature 20], confident that the beer is beer, gulps down a thiccc slice.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: I've been wondering why I never saw you again after you joined the group. I was hoping you'd come back and rescue me.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: I wanted to come back, but I had a falling out with the Maidens. I really did mean to. It got dangerous.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Things were dangerous for me as well. (She removes the white scarf from her neck, which is slit open to the spine.) I wish that you'd been able to protect me from him! (She points to the back corner, where a thuggish man awaits.) That trick I played on you didn't always go over as well; one time he did get violent before I could bring him back to the crew.</div>\n<div>Marcus: Is this one of the guys that tried to rip me off?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Meanwhile, still out in the larger room, Flick's pants fall down as, forgetting to cinch her belt cord after using it to illustrate a particularly sophisticated and boring concept pertaining to the quasi-geometric topology of planar travel [initiative 6] she tries to nod to Carlos that something's up in the 'bar' and, having tied her belt cord to the bowstring in her frantic haste, almost snaps her bow.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc, with grief, anger, and the general sense that something's not right here, charges Marcus. Marcus, exemplifying for Jean-Luc all the evils of urbanity, and swirling with a constellation of reminders of that criminally fraught life, goes dagger-to-Lydia (Jean-Luc's sword) and sustains a confident swipe to the arm.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marcus: We're all just the same to you, aren't we? Someone to take advantage of? Well, I'll show you how unique I am. (Reaching behind his head, he rips his face. Off. The skin, which was healthy, peels away to reveal grey and white rotting flesh suppurating with grey pus and rippling with maggots.)</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well, this is par for the course, though gross.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I didn't say I was gross, I said I was unique. Why, what are you seeing?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Just another nightmare I'll need to drink away.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I wouldn't trust the beer here. Your bartenders put sleeping potions in it sometimes.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>For just a moment Jean-Luc is overtaken by fear: his very organs tremble at the idea that this creature is getting closer. Somehow the presence of Marjorie gives him courage, or bravado, it's hard for him to know. Fittingly, Marcus runs behind the bar and attempts to hide.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez, stepping light in his Hedge-approved footwear, scurries into the bar and, from his privileged tiny tiny angle very close to the ground, sees the putrid reflection of Marcus in the lacquered and well-polished walls. He strides confidently up to the bar, climbs laboriously onto a barstool (smiling confidently all the while), and whips to either side of the zombielike creature to keep him petrified in place.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marcus: Ah, this crew is using whips now? How fancypants.</div>\n<div>Fez: I'm always looking for a new enemy to face.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I see what you did. But it seems a bit annoying if you're just an outsider who comes in to kill \"new\" people.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus [int 16], taking a moment to orient himself to the secret resonances of the Whispering Walls, wheezes into a nearby stone, \"Fellas, fellas, let's ... let's not fight. Can't you see this ghost is tearing us apart. I feel like this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship if we drop our arms and bring it in for a nice hug.\"</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Which ghost is he talking about?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus [performance 6] sprints up behind Marjorie, shouts \"You! You're the ghost!\" and then gently holds his hands up beside her face, delivers \"Fellas fellas stop fighting. It's not worth it\" in an unconvincing falsetto. Marcus asks, \"Is that really the pitch of your voice?\" Not to be dissuaded, Hieronymus continues, \"Jean-Luc, if you agree to put down your weapon and not fight anymore I'll give you a nice smoooooch!\" Jean-Luc, utterly baffled by this conflicting evidence, freezes out of indecisiveness. At the same time a shout is heard from the sub-basement.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Rotrude: Hieronymus, are you attempting to mess with someone's head, as you messed with mine, in pushing it under the lake?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Begone, vile creature!</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Yes, that is very familiar to what you said to me last time.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Uh, no, we ended on good terms.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Do you mean 10 seconds ago, when I was turned, or 10 minutes ago, when I emerged wet and sopping from the lake?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Every time we've seen each other our interactions have been great. So there's no need to bring up the past.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Once I get up there, I will dispute with you as is our custom in the monastery.</div>\n<div>Flick: Is this the one you killed?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Welllllll, she thinks I did.</div>\n<div>Flick: So you're the top line on the shitty monastery people list.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Pretty much everybody from my monastery was shitty.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Yes, I remember Germötrid used to sit on the frogs to indicate how much weight she was gaining, and she would measure it by the number of frogs she could kill merely by squatting on them.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Yes, I actually liked her. She was one of the good ones. And we had delicious frog dinners in those days.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: What else did you like about her?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: She was cool because she didn't go around drowning and blaming me for it. That's something that I really dislike in a person.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: It's ironic because you would often comment on how you loved it when the bottom of the monk's cassocks would become wettened, and you could see it stick to their spindly little legs.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Yes, who doesn't like that?</div>\n<div>Rotrude: You said it reminded you of your parents when they went wading for clams or mussels.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Heironymus, shouting \"Oh Nooooooooo!\" makes to leave the room to search for Rotrude.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos glances over at Amalia shadow-boxing with a potential adversary and, grumbling \"Go go hammer,\" covers the undead dwarf with the spiritual hammer and makes his way into the bar, nudging the unconscious Drav to rouse her. Rotrude, hearing 'Bruce' spoken from above, asks, \"Did someone mention Bruce? You should ask Hieronymus about a Bruce.\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez: I don't think anyone wants to poke that bear.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: Jean-Luc, why are you letting this strange-smelling, inappropriately hairy monk manipulate me like this? (and in so doing casts Vengeful Glare)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>At first, Jean-Luc feels terrified, but then remembers that she was one of the first people who tricked him, and reconsiders their entire relationship history in this context. In the other room, Amalia remains hunched up in the corner. Flick, having recovered herself after tripping on a loose stone spur, smirks towards Jean-Luc and asks if he needs any help. Jean-Luc, visibly reeling, welcomes with a nod this offer of assistance.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marcus: You sure keep a varied crew, don't you. I was expecting a bunch of rabscrabble humans, but this is quite unusual.</div>\n<div>Flick: Rabscrabble?</div>\n<div>Marcus: Yeah, that's a word in Kriobolis.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick, able to focus on the slash in Marjorie's neck, sends a javelin of force energy into the woman.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: Clearly my accusatory gaze isn't enough for you, Jean-Luc. When you abandoned me before, it caused my death: how can you not defend me now that I'm back?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: I assumed that you would be able to take care of yourself. (Though he's heard of revenants before, Marjorie appears to have a different agenda than most revenants. Nevertheless, feelings of guilt persist for him.) Put her down, Hieronymus!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc runs over to the bar, parkours against Hieronymus's face and a barstool, does a front-tuck and comes down with Lydia into Marcus, dinking him slightly as Marcus defends himself with his dagger. Jean-Luc, shouting \"I guess I should attack this guy. Don't worry, I won't fail you this time!\" gets begrudging respect from the gruff-speaking throat-slitter for his gymnastic performance.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marcus: I _thought_ you scumbags were working together. I do seem to have painted myself into a corner here, though. I've bet you've never done a good thing in your life.</div>\n<div>Flick: Our plans may not have the results we want, but we're not evil.</div>\n<div>Marcus: You certainly look like a group that has a _plan_ well in hand. I've walked twelve dogs simultaneously with more of a plan.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Finally, a real rescue attempt!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav awakens to find her friends running into this newly apparent pub; rushing up and into the room she's confronted with the rotting visage of Marcus across the bar and a strange woman with her throat slit and pointed towards Jean-Luc. Fez again rainbows his whip over the bar, slashing at the until recently unbuttoned sea-abyss-boiled leather armor of Marcus. Hieronymus, still wobbly from Jean-Luc's padded kick to his face, crawls, weeping shamefacedly, around the far end of the bar. \"I can't believe my best friend would be so careless as to kick me in the face.\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: There is no possible world in which I am your best friend. What about that mule you keep fucking?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: She's more of a confidant.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus attacks from the ground with his quarterstaff, making his way up the zomboid's body with each strike, finally landing one in the groin that doubles him over. He then forgoes an unarmed strike in order to attempt a jig on the bar, but slips on putrid flesh and falls back on his butt. His foot brushes up gently against Marcus's face, reminding him for a moment of Rotrude's post-drowning face.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marcus: You're not as good on your feet as this buttoned-up dandy next to me.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus is reminded of the briny marsh area near the lake where he used to go with Roxfallanah to reminisce about his odiferous family. He would cover his beloved mule with stinky mud and bring her back to the monastery to annoy everyone; like a cow, once brought up the stairs she couldn't go back down. She would remain where she was until a barn elevator was built to bring her down.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos, casting his eye on the two undead, for some reason doesn't believe Marjorie to be susceptible to Turn Undead. He calls down Sacred Flame on Marcus. Drav causes the far end of the bar to explode in shrapnel; Jean-Luc, still seeking to prove his worth, pulls a drink tray from under the bar and flips it in front of Marjorie's face, but it passes her too early to provide any cover.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie crawls across the bar to take out her rage on Jean-Luc. She smashes him with one of her calloused and workpersonlike fists. \"Taking my fate in my own ... HANDS ... energizes me,\" and she appears to heal the hole in her throat. Flick takes a cue from this fist and launches one of her own, as force, at Marcus, who shakes his head, \"Almost an honorable fistfight!\" The next arrow, a wooden one, reams a substantial hole in the zomboid's head as he collapses into a greenish salivary puddle. Marjorie and Flick have a dispute regarding their relationship to Jean-Luc.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Jean-Luc finally realizes that, no matter what \"Marjorie\" may be, it's not the historical and sociopersonal figure he's familiar with; no doubt feeling bad about it, he attacks her.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I knew you'd come after me brutally like this.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: YOU'RE NOT MARJORIE!</div>\n<div>Marjorie: You wish to take away my identity as well? ...I suppose this is a bit my fault. I've let myself get trapped by three feisty incels. I still think you should back off tho.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>As a gesture of goodwill (?) Hieronymus produces from his satchel a few flat round stones and massage oil, scooping some of Marcus's gluids into the ointment (a magical secretion of Roxfallanah's anal sacs) and rubs into Jean-Lucs shoulders the healing unguent. \"I hope that you'll remember this when the time comes to repay the favor,\" moans Hieronymous cringingly. Jean-Luc shudders to himself at the thought of what that might entail. Marjorie blasts Jean-Luc with an accusation of selfishness for keeping to himself the renewed vigor, at which Jean-Luc, really leaning into the incel thing, screams at her to shut up.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I would have attacked her but I'm afraid of her banter.</div>\n<div>Rotrude (from the floor below): I did always love our banter, and I do not know why you're being self-deprecating right now.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I'm going to banter you in the face!</div>\n<div>Rotrude: See, I love this.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav, shooting a firebolt, misses, being distracted by the sight of a small child crouching under the table to her right. Edging behind Carlos, Drav makes eye-contact with the child and motions towards Marjorie. \"Is this bad woman trying to hurt you?\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\"Drav, is that you? What are you doing up there? You're going to get hurt!\" Drav suddenly has a vague memory of this child: with her elf parents, she had to hide from them this part of her life. She had an imaginary friend that she knew she wasn't supposed to tell anyone about. It seems as though they've returned to her. Her name was Eldar, and Drav would get into scrapes exploring the woods, or sneaking into her parents' library to read books she wasn't supposed to. Eldar, though, looks frightened. [investigation 9] The table's shadow is obscuring her physiognomy too much to determine how 'alive' she is.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav crawls closer to the figure under the table, who whispers, \"We were just here a few moments ago. You stood up and started throwing all sorts of terrifying magic around.\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav: I was just under _here_?</div>\n<div>Eldar: Yeah, we were just under here playing.</div>\n<div>Drav: Have I grown up?</div>\n<div>Eldar: You've always changed a little differently than I have. I can still see that you're Drav; it doesn't matter that you look like an older dwarf now.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Drav moves close enough to touch the child; Carlos attempts to pull Drav backwards, but Drav slips out of his hands and makes it fully under the table. [insight 12] However real Drav knew that Eldar was when they were children, she seems to be more so now, despite being somewhat translucent. It seems enough unlike the \"undead goop monsters\" to stay close.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Eldar: I think we can sneak out the door and go exploring again!</div>\n<div>Drav: Yes, let's be very quiet and play hide-and-seek, and keep an eye out.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Eldar, whispering \"I think we should play tag instead,\" reaches out to touch Drav; where the wizard is touched, the flesh begins to wither away. Drav scrambles backwards as Eldar teases \"You're it!\" and bolts through the solid stone wall. Given the opportunity, Drav quickly scans the undersides of the other tables in the bar; seeing nothing, she stands up, only to notice a large glass jar containing loosely packed black soil on top of the table she was just tunder. [arcana 18] She hears a voice in her head: \"Tell Flick that the Shoemaker is here.\" Drav conveys the message to Flick, who recalls that Onfalon had spoken of a 'protector of the forest' Shoemaker Byte, rumored to be a spiritualist who kept spiritual entities in the basement of their creepy mansion; people would come to supplicate themselves and act as vessels for the spirits who would enter and provide drug-like experiences.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\"I told you this was a trap!\" Carlos intones, casting healing word. \"There's dirty dirty undeads everywhere!\" \"I should have listened to you, my wise elder,\" Drav responds. \"But Drav what's wrong with a little dirty now and then?\" Eldar shouts from her invisible location. Carlos, an imposing force for good, continues harboring her religious potential.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: You're slimy in your fighting as well as your life. Let me get a good punch in on you! --And you just see me as a meat puppet, do you? I like to make relationships with people, even the ones I'm going to rip off.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Flick unleashes another volley, gives a slightly paranoid glance to the table under which the child appeared, and asks Drav, \"Is that someone you know?\"</div>\n<div>Drav: It took the form of an imaginary friend I had in my youth, but it never did that.</div>\n<div>Flick: I should hope not.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Behind Drav, Flick sees a huge hulking figure step through the door: a bear twice the height of a human: Shoemaker Byte! She wears an iron kettle upside-down on her head and holds out a double-pawful of goodberries. \"Did you think these were coming out of thin air?\" [wis 6] Flick all of a sudden perceives the innate flammability of the wood in the bar, finding herself overtaken by the urge to make sure none of it sets on fire. The bear walks to the table next to Drav and smashes into the piece of furniture with a massive woodcutter's axe, shouting, \"this is all kindling! Make sure you get rid of it!\" and pushes Flick towards another one of the tables.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: What regrets do you have about me? I have regrets: That I ever knew you; that I got in with this crew; that I went after Marcus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Fez tries to whip off her head, as Hieronymus whips himself into a clunky pirouette, punching and swinging during the apogee of his revolutions until his last blow lands.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Marjorie: That's a lot of sound and fury.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I might give it another whirl.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Don't let him whirl you! It's another name for a swirly!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Carlos tries to Command Eldar, who, unaffected, giggles and runs further down the stairs. Inside the bar, Shoemaker is carrying the jar of soil. Drav launches a bolt of fire from her hands, igniting Marjorie's scarf and singeing some of her undead pluripotent stem cells. She tries to bring down Jean-Luc as a metonym for the crime syndicate. Flick, staring daggers at Drav for setting something aflame, takes a dampened misty step, fires a slug at Drav (who gets knocked prone), puts a mortal arrow through Marjorie (\"Jean-Luc, once again you leave me mur-dered!\" Heironymus claps him on the back, \"You sure know how to pick 'em, buddy\". Rotrude shouts, \"You sure had your share of pathetic girlfriends in your day as well. And you never wanted me to tell anyone, but that time you cheated on Roxfallanah.\" Hieronymus responds, \"Hey, why don't you try being Rote-nice for once, instead of Rote-rude.\" to which she says, \"I would have said Rote-kind \"), and pushes a table slightly closer to an outside wall of the bar, away from Drav. After this, Flick drops to the ground and rolls around to extinguish any possible flames on her person.&nbsp;</div>"}

Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure. A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose.

Having gotten Roxfallanah out of the doorway, Vengeance walks into the cottage; he's able to see that the figure is totally stone laid out on the ground, fairly symmetrically, and that (which he would have learned at the monastery, studying angels and demons) this is an Aasimar.

She does know one in the Steeplepeak Mountains, east of her adoptive homelands of Forest Ogrelodge. The problem is, they are already fairly close to their destination; it's kind of agricultural. there is organization going on around a bay to the southeast . there's one that she's heard about, on one of the islands. But she casts her mind back, and she sees that the fire of the cart has consumed the cart almost entirely; the ashes are still warm, and it looks like they are providing heat to these shards, that before may have blended in with the glass. Light-blue shards; it's the sort of crystalline or glass used to trap something or keep something inside of it. and it has exploded. to keep something incorporeal in it. (Was it in the cart?) Drav tries to see if something has been released. [Nat 20] She can sense that this kind of gem is used specifically to trap angels, and that it's been exploded, and that it was killed, or managed to escaped; they are kept trapped against their will; the deva escaped. They are not here anymore; the pattern that's left is one that looks like the deva -- as if reading the flame pattern from a rocket launch -- used this to return to one of the higher spheres. You'd need a connection to the divine to use this weird kind of teleportation circle. [They would need the same kind of technology to travel to and from a celestial teleportation thing of this different nature. They wouldn't be able to travel back unless they found a similar reverse pattern, even if they had the spells to do it. Even regular teleportation circles aren't terribly common.]</p>\n<p>\"Drav the Arcane Queen\". She mentions all this to the party while grabbing a crown to study later. Flick connects the aaetheral gemstones from the aetherial plane with what Drav has just spoken of. Flick: The starchild lifecycle sounds disgusting. (Startrella) Actually you just need to think about it from the perspective of accepting the natural world and the natural cycles and you'll be a little less judgmental. As larva, we can't afford to judge each other , since our lives are so precious, but also so meaningless because 9/10ths of us die before we can take our next form. That's only in part due to the ecology of the world, but also how harsh that particular planet it. I've wondered if it was designed to be that hard to weed out specimengs. I haven't achieved the final metamorphosis of brain elder yet, so … i'm going to leave the contemplation to then. You can really only understand the true name of elder brains by having cosmic background radiation converted into sound waves. i don't have the acoustic equipment . i have this sweet recording studio on Si'a.

Flick: our best bet is to get 300 feet to the west. jean-luc and i can be forward sentries. my guess is, the people inside the structure … if they stop, people will have to get out. Paros: they've already noticed me, somehow. if I hide, I shouldn't be hiding with anyone else. (Paros suspects that the telepathic presence can probably detect any intelligent life form, but he didn't feel it until 2 miles so that might be its maximum range.) </p>\n<p>(Have the mule fight the tower -- and turn it into power rangers)</p>\n<p>The decision is made to cast Enlarge/Reduce on Mule three times, and have the mule dash for almost the entire minute. [It is established that Vengeance keeps lizards and snakes inside the saddlebags] Flick goes to sell the plan to Aphelia. \"We're going to … run on a giant mule away from a mechobeast. Could you let me help you climb this tree to jump on?\" Aphelia begins playing a well-known Mule-travelling song on her dulcimer and looks pretty excited. </p>\n<p>Flick, having some kind of out of body experience, says \"I was worried she was going to be one of those prissy NPCs who are really difficult, but she's a good sport.\" </p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Someone isn't being difficult if they don't want to ride a giant mule. </p>\n<p>Flick: Even when you're traveling with us?</p>\n<p>Paros: Won't they notice a four-story-tall mule running around? </p>\n<p>Flick: we could also reduce the size of the siege engine. (But if it doesn't willingly submit it can make a CON save)</p>\n<p>[2:10]</p>\n<p>Flick gets up onto the roof, catches Mule's flank, and scrambles into her saddlebag. Flick uses her primeval awareness: \"First of all, thanks very much for being willing to carry us all this way, but it's really important she get us as far away from this thing as possible, and we'll get her all the strawberries she wants\" -- All the wild strawberries? You can make a promise. Can y0ou make sure this fishy man gets away from me? (Flick): That's another kind of action item we're going to have to worry about. (Roxfallanah): Action item? you seem very professional. (Flick) Crisis brings that out of me. We really have to get going. -- And then Mule takes off going 60 or 70 miles an hour, somehow leaving no trace of her passage. (Vengeance): How is she doing this having no calories? (Flick) I'll just give her a goodberry or two: I think that should take care of it.</p>\n<p>[2:40]</p>\n<p>WHen Mule shrinks to regular height you're lying face-first on the ground holding the strawberry up behind you, and she licks at Vengeance's balding pattern and takes the strawberry. Joan jumps off when Mule is still 40 feet high and only takes 4 damage because of rage. Drav and Jean-Luc fall off at 20 feet and take 10 damage [failing their DC 13 athletics / arobatics checks]. Startrella, either go big or go home, able to get to Si'a, can't dismount cleverly. Paros and Carlos stay on as Mule shrinks all the way. You are now a mile away from their overnight camp; looking back, they see that the tripod has stopped. Flick [nat 20] can see that it's extended tentacles from itself and it's emptying the boxes into a hatch opened in the back of the cabin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Flick): this is a very sophisticated piece of machinery</li>\n<li>(Jean-Luc): that just means there's more things that can go wrong, like if we just throw a fireball at it</li>\n<li>(Flick): well we can't be tracked for the next 55 minutes, as long as it doesn't have a line of sight on it. Part of me wishes you hadn't taken the hats …</li>\n<li>(Paros): But I need a hat.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Paros detects that his third eye is kind of sleepy, and it closes its lid.</p>"}

Joan, a true and loyal friend, kept Drav's memory alive by baptising a chondric mushroom fetus as ‘Dravita’ so the creature’s soul would not be forsaken to the plane of Limbo. Flick’s fragile constitution was put to the test after Carlos noticed and then eviscerated a squirrel that was pregnant with the nut-eggs of its own spider-squirrel squipiderlings, which soon followed their parent into the great gooey abyss of death. Equally curious, though far less gruesome, was a tall pole with a sparkling trinket at its top. The party’s attempts to retrieve the object of interest were thwarted until an exhibition of brute strength by Joan revealed that one of the six classical simple machines (screw threads, which, arguably, are an inclined plane (another simple machine) wrapped around a cylinder) were affixing the pole in the ground. Joan, like a luminous scaly wrench, screwed the pole into the ground until she could retrieve the black metallic sphere which lay in a divot at the top, promptly stuffing it into her backpack —&nbsp;itself still dripping with Dravita’s white ichor.</p>\n<p>As the party continued on their arrow-straight path towards Castle Karn, they heard the active sounds of a village ahead. Flick espied two armed witherlings headed aggressively towards the stead. Moving as quietly as a porcupine in outer space, our intrepid wood elf dismantled one of the creatures with two well-placed arrows and reported back to the party as the other witherling fled. Now on high alert, Flick, Carlos, and Joan approached what they believed to be the sounds of the village, only to discover that the noises were emanating from a grotesque incel-informed parody of a cervid, replete with neckbeard, a propensity for vacuous mimicry, and razor-sharp bone ridges substituting for teeth. Already engaged in battle against the creature were two witherlings and a human sorcerer, Paros. With such concentrated firepower, the monster was soon reduced to a slubbering puddle of flesh, and the witherlings (now, it was clear, a more morally sophisticated group than had been originally assumed) pointed the gang towards the purportedly hospitable and welcoming pale of the gnoll village.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c2f8c73-7fff-62fb-e338-71780689c60e\"></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"ludmillasperski\">— Ludmilla Sperski</h4>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>"}
