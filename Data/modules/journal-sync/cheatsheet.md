# cheatsheet

1. Obviously, items that are specific to the characters but also allow them to assay the next stage of the campaign
2. Not sure if this is clue, foreshadowing, pip, or homebrewing-for-the-sake-of-homebrewing, but the jellyfish that healed/hurt (biological experiments, pip to hurt, foreshadowing with this elf's testtube babies, unexpected)
3. many levels (down/below, side/pocket dimension, past/history, future/plans)
4. imagine possible ways for battles / interactions to go
5. tons of easter eggs ? 
	- ooh, an "eater egg"
6. putting conspicuous things around an area you want explored (because that area has a thing important to find).
	- emily putting the origami birds on the bookshelf, and the bookshelf contained the snakeskin journal
7. __in more ways than one__
- packs a punch
8. separate items for characters from items that to-kill NPCs might drop?

ki as the key

9. little bat claws that wrap around two of their fingers , like rings, - can turn into a bat
10. for "puzzles" - have it turn into combat if it goes weird, and also make it multi-stage or multi-step
11. for skipping from NPC to NPC : introduce or transition by describing what they are doing physically (they twiddle things fingers, lick their lips, etc)
12.
