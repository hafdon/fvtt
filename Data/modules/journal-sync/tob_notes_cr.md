# TOB notes 

eversmoking bottle (jean-luc)
hat of disguise (jean-luc)


## ToDo
- establish major astrological and seasonal events 

### Witchlight
- __mystery__: Evil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o'- wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. 

### [Mountain Adder or Mountain Viper (very beautiful snakes), based on] Swamp Adder
- __trade__: A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more on the black market.

### Suturefly
- __gitm__: tricked into sewing people up for medicine (oh but ... reengineered? or combined with Dipsa's anaesthetic? engineered into one creature?)
- __mystery__: bunch of people with sewed up holes; what did it?!  

### Ramag
- __character development__: could teach Flick how to travel
### Shadow Fey
- __character development__: teach Flick about Shadow Roads 


### Cikivak  
- used by thieves (for secret pouches)
- dagger beaks
- regular folks can summon them
- can cast silence

### Shroud  
- __combat__: can reduce Strength on a hit
- __clue giver__: Shrouds cannot converse, but they occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term, or phrase over and over again: something that must have had meaning to them in life.

### Wharfling
- near lakes
- move in family groups of 3 or more.
- steal things
- __combat__: steal things while grappled

### Azza Gremlin  
- can detect EM fields
- can amplify lightning (Joan)
- __ghost in the machine__: could power things with lightning
- __ghost in the machine__: can communicate at long distances, since they can travel on lightning bolts

### Dipsa
- like __Treacle__, but lower CR
- __trade goods__: venom has anaesthetic quality
- __trade goods__: venom breaks down tissue (use as a tenderizer, by denaturing or unwinding the long protein in muscle)
- __trade goods__: Dipsa caviar (eaten with the equivalent of mother-of-pearl caviar spoons) (technically caviar substitute, as caviar is only from roe in certain areas of asia minor -- of course, in this world, it could be dipsaviar ?)
	- perhaps the "highly acidic" milt is pickled, fried, or used as a topping

### Erina, Erina Defender
- I should definitely do more research on hedgehogs
- their spines never break and can hold poison
	- https://animaldiversity.org/collections/spinesquills/
	- __trade goods__: perhaps have them given as gifts to Flick, etc.
- they don't really molt, but they undergo "quilling" which is like losing their baby quills

### Kalke  - sort of a model for Cthulhu investigators
- __combat__: this is not reflected in their statblock: all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.
- __ghost in the machine__: (They could be used as beacons essentially). Kalkes can sense spellcasting in a 5-mile radius, as long as the effect is not innate.
- __hoard__: compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia
- __mystery__: Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away & kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. 
- __mystery__: the rituals, with unpredictable effects

### Map Mimic
- __trade goods__: their "glue" (adhesive) is very strong but has to be pasteurized / blanched, etc because it contains millions of larvae

---

## Jungle or Forest
- Crimson Drake
### Red-Banded Line Spider
- __trade__: exotic pets, removed venom sacks, "mousers" sometimes used for divination

## Urban
- Roachling Skirmisher
- Ratfolk
- Alehouse Drake
	- __clue giver__: Relentless Gossips. Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and often trade in information, making them good sources for news about town.
	- __mystery__: More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.
- Morphoi
	- Those chosen as infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the two species to interbreed.
	- __character__ oh boy what if Lydia was a Morphoi (island hook too)

## Hi-tech
- Xanka
- Clockwork Beetle
	- __mystery__: Hidden Timers. The most talented gear.mages occasionally design a clockwork beetle with a hidden countdown clock that silently ticks down over years or even decades. When the tightly wound gear-counter expires, it suddenly triggers a mechanical metamorphosis within the beetle, causing it to rapidly transform and blossom into a completely different clockwork creature—a wondrous surprise known in advance only to the designer who created it so many years ago.
- Clockwork Watchman
- Library Automaton

## Gormflaith & Swamps
- Beggar Ghouls ("Others were exiled from the empire without the resources to fend for themselves.")
- Miremal 
	- __tricky__:  delight in crafting seemingly safe paths through treacherous swamps—though these paths are, instead, riddled with traps and ambush points.
- Glass Gator

## Farming
- Tosculi Drone
- Crimson Drake

## Mountains
- Dogmole
	- used by dwarves, derro, miners
- Skin bat?
	- __hoard__: occasionally a ring or necklace from a past victim gets embedded in their fleshy folds
	- 8-foot wingspan!
- Glass Gator as larva?
	- Larval Form. Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It's been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.


### Fraughashar
- revere rivers, gorges, lakes, peaks
- fiercely protective
- __character__: druids and mountain people know of them; also bards in their tales
- just annoying, but 

## Islands, Ships
- Morphoi
- Rum Gremlin
- Gerridae (giant water striders, basically)

## Magic?
