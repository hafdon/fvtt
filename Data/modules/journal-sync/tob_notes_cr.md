# TOB notes 

eversmoking bottle (jean-luc)
hat of disguise (jean-luc)

## ToDo
- establish major astrological and seasonal events 

### Witchlight
- __mystery__: Evil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o'- wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. 

### [Mountain Adder or Mountain Viper (very beautiful snakes), based on] Swamp Adder
- __trade__: A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more on the black market.

### Suturefly
- __gitm__: tricked into sewing people up for medicine (oh but ... reengineered? or combined with Dipsa's anaesthetic? engineered into one creature?)
- __mystery__: bunch of people with sewed up holes; what did it?!  

### Ramag
- __character development__: could teach Flick how to travel
### Shadow Fey
- __character development__: teach Flick about Shadow Roads 

### Ratfolk
- __character development__: could comprise some of the members of city guilds or gangs for Jean-Luc

### Cikivak  
- used by thieves (for secret pouches)
- dagger beaks
- regular folks can summon them
- can cast silence

### Shroud  
- __combat__: can reduce Strength on a hit
- __clue giver__: Shrouds cannot converse, but they occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term, or phrase over and over again: something that must have had meaning to them in life.

### Wharfling
- near lakes
- move in family groups of 3 or more.
- steal things
- __combat__: steal things while grappled

### Azza Gremlin  
- can detect EM fields
- can amplify lightning (Joan)
- __ghost in the machine__: could power things with lightning
- __ghost in the machine__: can communicate at long distances, since they can travel on lightning bolts

### Dipsa
- like __Treacle__, but lower CR
- __trade goods__: venom has anaesthetic quality
- __trade goods__: venom breaks down tissue (use as a tenderizer, by denaturing or unwinding the long protein in muscle)
- __trade goods__: Dipsa caviar (eaten with the equivalent of mother-of-pearl caviar spoons) (technically caviar substitute, as caviar is only from roe in certain areas of asia minor -- of course, in this world, it could be dipsaviar ?)
	- perhaps the "highly acidic" milt is pickled, fried, or used as a topping

### Erina, Erina Defender
- I should definitely do more research on hedgehogs
- their spines never break and can hold poison
	- https://animaldiversity.org/collections/spinesquills/
	- __trade goods__: perhaps have them given as gifts to Flick, etc.
- they don't really molt, but they undergo "quilling" which is like losing their baby quills

### Kalke  
- __combat__: this is not reflected in their statblock: all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.
- __ghost in the machine__: (They could be used as beacons essentially). Kalkes can sense spellcasting in a 5-mile radius, as long as the effect is not innate.
- __hoard__: compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia
- __mystery__: Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away & kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. 
- __mystery__: the rituals, with unpredictable effects

### Map Mimic
- __trade goods__: their "glue" (adhesive) is very strong but has to be pasteurized because it contains millions of larvae

---

## Stato's Den  

### Clurichaun (by a different name)  
  - perhaps in a ground-level wine or beer cellar
  - "tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks" unless well-supplied with alcohol, in which case they guard the cellars
  - __attrition__: can make adventurers feel hung-over next day
- serve __dipsaviar__ from the lake

### Garroter Crabs
- maybe some __Garroter Crabs__ ("aggressive, blue-black freshwater crabs"), which are alternately seen as divine and respected and sacred (and used for augury), or tasty and eaten
	- __trade goods__: serve Garroter Crabs in dipsa milt ("dipsoft")

### Bone Crab
- __trade__: bone crab legs ("incredibly powerful"), good eating
- __clues__: the bone-home in which they live is the skull of a missing person? a kind of monster no one thought was alive anymore? 
	- Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.
- this is definitely not true as a cause, since all crabs are scavengers (White Ghost Shivers), but there's probably something else going on misattributed to the crab's flesh: "Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease—white ghost shivers, which wrack victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a bone crab's unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it." - it actually sounds like a drug trip. hallucinations. (probably just crabs around a certain type of food source)

### Living Wicks
- unlit __Living Wicks__ are under the drop cloths in the backroom of Stato's
	- __combat__: Vengeance or anyone else could command them (and then a fight to extinguish them) "Living wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic."
	- __combat__: also a self-destruct mechanism: If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames.

### Bucca
- love to steal from miners: Hidden in Crevices. Buccas are tiny, underground faeries who are also known as "snatchers," because they love to steal from miners and hoard precious minerals and gems in tiny, trap.filled crevices. Their small size makes them easy to overlook.
- __character__: Drav might know about them: Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.

### Empty Cloak
- perhaps upon a Living Wick or actual mannequin 

### Lantern drake
- that feeds on the Living Wicks, -- hence the Empty Cloak? Unless Palchin considers it good luck
- __clues__ __character__ loves discussing magic and history (telepathically of course) 
- __suspense__ if caught in magical darkness it can't fly or glow and takes radiant damage.

### Boloti
- __combat__ (for the lake)

 
## Postmaster Buddock  
- Stryx owl-things as owls

### Red-Banded Line Spider
- __trade__: exotic pets, removed venom sacks, "mousers" sometimes used for divination

## Urban
- Roachling Skirmisher
- Ratfolk
- Alehouse Drake
	- __clue giver__: Relentless Gossips. Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and often trade in information, making them good sources for news about town.
	- __mystery__: More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.
- Morphoi
	- Those chosen as infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the two species to interbreed.
	- __character__ oh boy what if Lydia was a Morphoi (island hook too)

## Hi-tech
- Xanka
- Clockwork Beetle
	- __mystery__: Hidden Timers. The most talented gear.mages occasionally design a clockwork beetle with a hidden countdown clock that silently ticks down over years or even decades. When the tightly wound gear-counter expires, it suddenly triggers a mechanical metamorphosis within the beetle, causing it to rapidly transform and blossom into a completely different clockwork creature—a wondrous surprise known in advance only to the designer who created it so many years ago.
- Clockwork Watchman
- Library Automaton

## Gormflaith & Swamps
- Beggar Ghouls ("Others were exiled from the empire without the resources to fend for themselves.")

	- used by dwarves, derro, miners

	- 8-foot wingspan!
- Glass Gator as larva?
	- Larval Form. Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It's been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.
