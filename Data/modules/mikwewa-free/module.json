Their compendium of scenes includes a wide variety of dungeons, caverns, and outdoor scenes to challenge your players, as well as ten unique shops to entertain them when they return to town!</p>All maps have been pre-configured with walls and lighting, and updated to incorporate support for Foundry VTT's advanced lighting animations. Enjoy your adventuring and have fun!</p>",
