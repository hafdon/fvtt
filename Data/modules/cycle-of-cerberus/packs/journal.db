The characters must track down one cyclops before they learn of their objective and of another cyclops roaming around. The party can choose to use force or they can help the cyclops brothers gain their golden apple. The Head Steward’s daughter guards these secret apples, but could be convinced to help.</p>\n<h1>Breaking and Entering</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.zf4tLE5NHQLrz4ut]{Chiron}&nbsp;seeks out the characters and beseeches them in a manner more urgent than normal, all while ushering them towards the orchard. He tells them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The orchard is under attack from some manner of giant; tearing through the trees and causing massive destruction. The monster must be stopped.</li>\n<li>His daughter works within the walls and hasn’t been heard from or seen since. Worrying for her wellbeing against such a creature, he asks if the characters could find some sign she is ok. The Head Steward also knows the following information, which he will not share unless pressed and has formed a trusting relationship with the characters:</li>\n<li>The orchard guards a secret, a gift from Hera: hidden in the center of the orchard is a tree which bears golden apples.</li>\n<li>The apples are said to grant great knowledge; not necessarily insights you want, but certainly what you need.</li>\n<li>He dreads what destructive creatures could do with such a boon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The orchard is walled in, the main entrance marked with tall bronze gates decorated with a full sized apple tree cleaved in half where the two gates meet. Instead of stopping here, Chiron leads the party to a massive hole in the wall, certainly big enough for a giant to pass through.</p>\n<h2>Following the Footprints</h2>\n<p>Inside the walls, the orchard is surprisingly expansive, meaning tracking will take quite some time. Large footprints and a path of ruined trees make for an easy <strong>Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> to track the 'monster'. Regardless of their roll the giant will be found, however, their result will allow them to learn some interesting clues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 5</strong> - The wandering footsteps seem erratic, almost directionless. It makes the path muddied and slightly harder to track.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 10</strong> - Although it’s clear many trees have been bent and broken to be moved out of the way, some trees have also been broken in a peculiar way; some cleaved vertically in two, some with all of their branches ripped off, and some broken at their middle where the top hangs off haphazardly.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 15</strong> - There are in fact two sets of tracks, and it's clear now they are searching. The tracks become increasingly erratic, almost certainly looping around on themselves at one point before splitting off.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 20</strong> - The trees have moved, very subtly. The view behind you is not the view you passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before the loop mentioned in the third clue completes itself, the characters can hear shouting from ahead in a deep, bellowing tone. \"Aegeus\" it cries out, distressed, \"Aegeus!</p>\n<h2>Pavlos, the Cyclops</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Approaching the shouting and cresting around the felled tree ahead, you see about 70 feet away a massive humanoid, though slightly small for a giant. They are wrapped in muddied robes, wide at the waist but with clearly toned arms to make light work of tearing down trees. They slowly spin around, crying out “Aegeus” again before placing their hands atop their bald head and dropping to sit on the ground. The orchard is now silent, apart from a faint sound of weeping, tears trickling down their single, large eye.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.t73VYnieH461Or6a]{Pavlos} will appear frantic and defensive against the armed characters, though he is at his heart always kind. Above all Pavlos will choose to talk instead of fight, communicating any or all of the following information to the characters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Pavlos has lost his brother, Aegeus, in their search of the orchard.</li>\n<li>The layout and shifting nature of the orchard means they keep getting lost and turned around.</li>\n<li>The two cyclopes are just looking for \"their apples\".</li>\n<li>With a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check, Pavlos will tell the characters about the secret golden apple tree he and his brother have been looking for, and how it will bestow on them the great gift of knowledge, and how to live happily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the conversation Pavlos will ask for as many as two things from the characters, figuring them to be more capable than himself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To have them find his brother and bring him back so they may continue their search.</li>\n<li>If the characters begin to show any hostility, he asks for mercy, vowing he and Aegeus will leave peacefully if they get their apple.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the characters choose to attack Pavlos, he will not fight to the death, and acts in self defense. In moments of having the upper hand he will offer the characters their lives in exchange for helping guide him to his brother and helping retrieve their apples.</p>\n<p>Pavlos and his brother, Aegeus, use the orchard cyclops stat block.</p>\n<h2>Continuing the Search</h2>\n<p>Whether the characters decide to help Pavlos or slay him, they must now track down @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.zbMWMUCpzvXwodpC]{Aegeus} and possibly the mysterious apple.</p>\n<p>Until now the tracks had nearly circled the orchard's perimeter, however one set of footprints abruptly veers off along one of the rows of trees, trying to cut between them, then breaking through a woven wall of trees and brush. Tracking down Aegeus is easy - The tracks are clear, though their direction seems aimless and without any rhyme or reason. A <strong>Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> determines how long the search lasts; between 20 minutes to 2 hours. The tracks eventually meander towards the orchard’s center.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The trunks of trees thicken with age as you march closer to the orchard’s center. Voluminous canopies threaten to blot out the light, any sound from the outside world is dampened to a whisper. Smells of crisp apples have been replaced with dirt, bark, and must. Your stomachs lurch as a light tremor echoes through the ground. Another tremor strikes, followed by more in a rhythm akin to footsteps.</p>\n<p>Broaching forwards, streaks of golden light break through, glinting amongst the trees. Amidst the pounding a subtle sound permeates the air; moments of hissing, like wisps of smoke through the air. The condensed forest opens to a clearing; in the center is a tree larger than the others, surrounded by a hundred or so snakes. A dark skinned female centaur with radiant copper hair stands at the edge of the snakes, adorned in polished silver armor inlaid with bronze vinework and a glaive firmly in hand. Her eyes trace a cyclops’ path as he paces around the tree, peering at glinting golden apples.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Around the tree are 10 @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.2PD1kXZCNP7Zbxvs]{Swarm of Poisonous Snakes} which move in a perimeter of 15 feet away from the base of the trunk. They attack any creature entering this area. If the creature withdraws without attacking any of the snakes, the snakes will not leave the area. Otherwise, any snake swarms which have been hit will pursue their attacker, fighting to the death.</p>\n<p>If the characters rolled well to find Aegeus or the Golden Apple Tree, the cyclops would have only just arrived. However, if they rolled poorly, the cyclops will have been here for a while and made unsuccessful attempts at the apples using his long reach. As a result there are 2 fewer snake swarms, and Aegeus has 20 fewer hit points.</p>\n<p>The centaur is Chiron's daughter, @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.gFiR3FQ2HaqdQw0P]{Thales}, guardian of the golden apples. She will greet the characters as they become visible, introducing herself and cordially asking about their business at the orchard. If the characters share their agreement to help retrieve apples for Pavlos and Aegeus, she will offer the same deal she offered Aegeus:</p>\n<p>If they are able to successfully retrieve an apple, without damaging the tree and survive any snakes which attack, then it is theirs. She will not hinder their efforts.</p>\n<p>However, if the characters give no reason for their needing an apple, Thales will block any attempts made citing that they do not have permission.</p>\n<p>Aegeus constantly circles the tree, and will listen to the characters’ conversations as best he can. He is wary and not as friendly as his brother, but is amiable if the characters are kind to him. If they mention their agreement with Pavlos, his disposition will lighten immensely and will cooperate as best as he can.</p>\n<h2>Taking the Eye</h2>\n<p>If the characters decide to attack Aegeus, he will retaliate aggressively, but not necessarily to the death:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The moment his hit points reach 25, he will use his next turn to drop to his knees and attempt to surrender, running away if the characters do not yield.</li>\n<li>Being wary of the snakes or damaging the tree, he will attempt to avoid these.</li>\n<li>Aegeus isn’t merciless. If a character falls, he will offer everyone the chance to surrender and help him retrieve an apple, only continuing to attack if they do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the party killed Pavlos earlier and a character shares this information, Aegeus will fight to the death, focusing on that character first.</p>\n<p>Thales will not intervene with the fight unless the tree is damaged or if the characters were able to persuade her with a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check beforehand. She uses the centaur stat block.</p>\n<h2>Taking the Apple</h2>\n<p>The golden apple tree does not seem to bear much fruit, only a few apples are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lowest apple is 20 feet off the ground, close to the trunk.</li>\n<li>Another is visible at 30 feet off the ground, closer to the middle of a branch.</li>\n<li>One concealed apple can be found with a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> by a creature in the tree 20 feet up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the characters explained their intent to help the cyclopes, they may be able to persuade Thales to retrieve the apples for them with a <strong>DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, retrieving the apples will require some creativity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any climbing in the tree requires a <strong>DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>, or they will fall.</li>\n<li>Aegeus can be persuaded to throw a character into the tree, aiming for either of the visible apples. The thrown character must make a <strong>DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</strong> to successfully grab hold.</li>\n<li>Mage Hand can reach the lowest apples without the caster stepping within the snake’s perimeter.</li>\n<li>The apples will fall if the tree is shaken vigorously enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any damage done to the tree, Thales will be obligated to deal back to any offending creatures.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>If the characters helped the brothers obtain apples, they will honor their bargain and leave peacefully, waiting to consume their apples in safety. However, they do need to be guided out of the orchard.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which approach the characters took, Thales will remain at the tree. If the characters took the compassionate approach and helped the brothers she will reward them with a golden apple.</p>\n<p>Chiron will be pacing anxiously around the village, eagerly waiting to hear of his daughter’s wellbeing and the monster’s demise, though is understanding if the characters explain their peaceful approach. For their work he’ll award them with 1100 gp.</p>\n<h2>Consuming the Golden Apple</h2>\n<p>If a character opts to eat the @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.items.dvloQ0atYOqOr0mS]{Golden Apple of Insight}, their mind is flooded with insights on Cerberus. They are granted knowledge of the creature’s various weak points, as represented by a pool of ten D8s. During combat they can exploit a weakness by spending from the pool in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a bonus action on your turn you focus your attack on a weak point, granting a bonus D8 to either your attack or damage roll.</li>\n<li>When an ally you can see makes an attack against Cerberus, you can spend a reaction to call out an instruction on how or where to attack, granting the ally a D8 to use on their attack or damage roll.</li>\n</ul>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L11.png"}

In this Labor, the characters must find and capture the boar at its mountain lair to restore the once peaceful beast to its natural state.</p>\n<h1>Aclippe's Request</h1>\n<p>Aclippe meets the characters in Kalogeros and explains to them that a number of villagers have been attacked by one of Artemis’ blessed boars while out on routine hunting trips. Usually peaceful, witness accounts imply that the boar is possessed by a dark spirit from the Underworld.</p>\n<p>Aclippe asks the characters to keep the boar alive and bring it back to her so she can examine and heal the beast. She tells the characters that the boar lives somewhere on Mount Erymanthus, not far from Kalogeros.</p>\n<p>The boar is also important to the centaurs that live on the mountain as its tusks possess a magical hardiness. The centaurs have fashioned weapons from the tusks, obtaining the ivory by giving the boar an offering upon which the boar allows the centaurs to harvest its tusks.</p>\n<p>Before the characters venture out, Aclippe also offers a heavy wooden cart in order to transport the creature back to Kalogeros. The cart is a 5ft by 15ft by 2ft open wagon, it has a capacity of 1000 lbs, AC 13 and 30HP and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You enter a thick forest, at the middle of which you see a tall peak rising from above the treeline. When you enter you see the sun as it filters through the bright green canopy, and sounds of many birds and beasts milling around for food can be heard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Kleptos</h2>\n<p>Once they near the lair the characters will encounter a party of four <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"OYfsLvjiHU82JAGz\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Centaurs</a>. One of these centaurs is a male named <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"sywp6wLHy6d5qxWN\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Kleptos</a> who asks the characters’ business in the woods.</p>\n<p>Kleptos does not recognize the characters as stewards, and suspects them to be escapees of the Underworld and a potential threat to the forest. Kleptos and his tribe use the boar's tusks to make their weapons, and therefore get defensive if the characters say they want to harm the beast in any way. If the characters act hostile or threaten any of the centaurs, Kleptos orders an attack. The centaurs fight until half their numbers fall, after which the rest attempt to flee into the woods. The characters can attempt with a <strong>DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong> to form an alliance with Kleptos and his centaurs on the condition the boar is not killed. With a success Kleptos offers two centaurs to accompany the party. You enter a thick forest, at the middle of which you see a tall peak rising from above the treeline. When you enter you see the sun as it filters through the bright green canopy, and sounds of many birds and beasts milling around for food can be heard.</p>\n<h2>Mountain Valley</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Further you push on through the woods, you see the mountain peak looming in the distance just between the trees. Eventually the thick tree canopy gives way to a small clearing. A lazy river flows across between rocks and felled trees in the area. A tall mountain shelf rises 30ft to the west eventually climbing to the peak of the mountain itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eventually the characters will reach a small mountain clearing with the following features:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cave.</strong></em> A small cave at the north end of the clearing is the lair of the crazed boar. The cave is littered with heavy footprints and the strong stench of swine. The cave floor is a slippery mixture of mud, bones and animal offal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>River. </strong></em>The stream is 5ft deep flowing sluggishly from north to south. Rocks and logs. Rocks and fallen trees (broken from the boar's aggression) litter the western section of this area and is considered difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cliffside.</strong></em> A rocky cliff face rises 30 feet above the clearing. To climb it, a creature must succeed on a <strong>DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Loose Rocks.</strong></em> Several boulders in a portion of the east cliffside are loose and collapse if the rockface receives too much damage. The rock has AC 12 and 50 HP as well as an immunity to poison and psychic damage. Once the wall is reduced to 0 HP a rockslide occurs. Each creature in the 15ft area must succeed on a <strong>DC 13 Dexterity (Athletics) check</strong> or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.</p>\n<h2>The Den of the Beast</h2>\n<p>As the characters approach the cave in the mountain clearing they notice a hairy mass rooting through a muddy mess of metal scraps and debris. Have the characters make a DC 14 (Dexterity) Stealth check against the boar's passive Perception. If half or more fail the boar turns its attention to the intruders.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treasure. </strong></em>The armour and weapons in the cave are unsalvageable but a thorough search of the mess reveals 50gp in coins.</p>\n<h1>The Erymanthean Boar</h1>\n<p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"FwgmZVHfo0mYmh1v\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Possessed Giant Boar</a> fights with anger and without mercy.. It is fueled by a dark hateful spirit from the Underworld that seeks to only kill. The boar uses its charge action as much as it can, trying to gore its enemies with its tusks while avoiding the river as it has slower movement in it.</p>\n<h2>Capturing the Boar</h2>\n<p>There are several ways of capturing the boar. One way is to overwhelm the beast and catch it in a net or with rope. When the boar is weakened below half its hit points it will be less likely to have the strength to resist being bound. Once the boar is subdued and captured it can be transported back to <a class=\"entity-link broken\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.journal\" data-id=\"Vj7hF2ovsy6gEvIg\"><i class=\"fas fa-unlink\"></i> A1.

A cleric or paladin may be able to free the boar from its spiritual possession by finding out the beast's affliction with a successful <strong>DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check</strong>. The possession can be removed with a dispel good and evil spell.</p>\n<h2>Return to Town</h2>\n<p>If the characters manage to keep the wagon intact on their journey they can move the captured boar onto it with a combined strength score of 60 or with magic. Once in town, Aclippe surveys the beast and uses dispel evil and good to remove the Underworld spirit. As a token of gratitude the boar offers both of its enchanted <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.items\" data-id=\"2wVfguqWKSylbOHB\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Tusk of Erymanthus</a> (that replenish in 1d6 weeks) to the characters by bowing its head to them.

If the centaurs are not present the characters are confronted regardless in 1d4 days by the centaurs seeking retribution for the boar's death.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L04.png"}
{"_id":"09uCjgsUbIVCnei6","name":"L03. The Hind of Artemis","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":350000,"flags":{},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>By DM Tuz</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The players are informed over troubling sightings of the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"agpozimZQH78uu9b\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Hind of Artemis</a>. Apparently the sacred animal has been injured by an unknown creature. The players must capture the frightened Hind to treat its wounds and perhaps uncover what monster wounded it in the first place.</p>\n<h1>Acclipe's Request</h1>\n<p>Once the characters have proven themselves after successfully dealing with the werelion and the hydra, Aclippe will soon approach them with another task. This time, the Hind of Artemis is in danger.</p>\n<p>Aclippe will inform them about troubling reports on the Hind of Artemis. The Hind has been seen limping in her native woods and acting on edge more than usual. The steward suspects that someone or something has attacked the Hind with the intent of killing her. The fact alone that this entity was able to hurt the Hind is troubling, as the Hind of Artemis is renowned for her fleetness of foot and ability to escape any predator. The steward asks the player characters to investigate the situation and gives them directions to the last place the wounded Hind was seen. The players must find her and tend to her wounds.</p>\n<p>The steward can communicate any or all of the following to the players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Hind of Artemis is a divine beast, blessed by Artemis with golden horns that give her godly speed. The Hind serves as a test to the chosen hunters of Artemis, to prove their hunting prowess by stalking and subduing the Hind without killing her.</li>\n<li>The hind resides in the great forest at the foot of Mount Olympus. The majestic forest serves as Artemis’ domain and is inhabited by magnificent game to hunt.</li>\n<li>Chasing after the Hind will be a fool's errand. Her speed is too great. Cunning and wits, or a communication of good intentions will be critical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cause of its injury is unknown. Any extra help the characters can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<h1>The Forest of Artemis</h1>\n<p>The Forest of Artemis is found eight miles south of the village. Soon after arriving, the players find the first evidence of the Hind of Artemis, in the form of golden blood stains spattered onto the forest floor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rows of impressively towering trees and creeping shrubs signify the entrance into Artemis’ hunting ground. No clear path is visible; a trail must be made. Not far into the verdant domain, glints of sparkling droplets catch your eyes. A spray of golden blood is spread among the foliage that reflects the few dappled rays of light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> is needed to follow the tracks of golden blood to the Hind. The check represents an hour of tracking. Because of the luminescence of the Hind’s blood, it is impossible to permanently lose the track, so even in case of failure, they are bound to find the Hind. Each failed check results in an additional hour spent wandering the forest. This wandering will alert the ettercaps who have invaded the forest, who may become aware of the player characters and prepare for their possible approach (see “Hunting the Ettercaps”).</p>\n<p>If the player characters succeed the survival check by 5 or more, they will also find the site where the Hind has been attacked along the way: a small forest clearing that shows signs of battle, as well as the remains of a trap made out of silken, spider-like webbing. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> shows that 4 upright standing creatures must have ambushed the Hind after entrapping it in webs. Based on that evidence a successful <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Nature) check</strong> will inform the players that 4 Ettercaps must have attacked the Hind. After investigating the ambush site, the player characters resume tracking the Hind.</p>\n<p>At your discretion you can also feature a random encounter with the beasts of the forest at this point, either as a result of the failed survival check, or to add more combat to the adventure. The player characters will eventually find the Hind, resting and tending to her wounds in a quiet grove.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You come across a peculiar sight in this quiet clearing- a magnificent deer with brilliant golden antlers lies in the open, licking at open wounds on its left flank. Even from here, you can tell the wounds are discolored and festering, and though the deer is stricken, it regularly stops to scan its surroundings, wary of attackers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the players approach the Hind by any means other than stealth she will flee. If the player characters are able to beat her high passive Perception (20), allow them to make one effort in apprehending or calming the Hind any way they see fit with a DC 15 for a skill check they want to try. On a success, this will count as one success towards the total successes needed in the upcoming skill challenge.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Hind will still flee, as she is in a distressed state and will use her once per day ability to cast time stop to give herself a head-start.</p>\n<h2>Skill Challenge: The Chase</h2>\n<p>The players will have to cooperate if they want to stand a chance to catch the panicked Hind of Artemis! Roll initiative and have the player characters take turns to make skill checks or suggest solutions in how to catch the Hind. To do so they must achieve five successes before three failures. Using spells like Web or other alternative solutions that the DM determines reasonably effective may result in 1 success.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Skill DCs depend on what skill the player is trying to use and how they are trying to use it. This is left to DM interpretation.</p>\n</section>\n<p>You come across a peculiar sight in this quiet clearing- a magnificent deer with brilliant golden antlers lies in the open, licking at open wounds on its left flank. Even from here, you can tell the wounds are discolored and festering, and though the deer is stricken, it regularly stops to scan its surroundings, wary of attackers. On a failed check, the character becomes either injured or the strain from the chase catches up with them and they take damage equal to their hit dice (if they have multiple hit dice, choose the highest). If this damage would reduce them to 0, they are reduced to 1 hit point instead and simply become incapacitated for 1 minute, as they pass out from exhaustion and are no longer able to keep up the chase.</p>\n<p>Examples of how skills may be used include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Athletics to sprint at a steady pace</li>\n<li>Insight to guess where the Hind may be headed.</li>\n<li>Acrobatics to vault over fallen trees and branches.</li>\n<li>Survival to set a trap for the Hind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of each round of the Skill challenge, the player characters must make a <strong>DC 10 Constitution saving throw</strong>. On a failed save the chase becomes taxing on the body of the character and they lose one hit dice. If they currently have 0 hit dice, they gain a level of exhaustion instead. As soon as they have 3 or more levels of exhaustion they can no longer participate in the chase. The difficulty of the Constitution saving throw DC is increased by 1 for each round that passes beyond the first.</p>\n<p>If the players are not successful they lose track of the Hind and have to attempt to find her again on the next day. This will mean that the ettercaps become aware of the adventurer’s presence in Artemis’ Forest if they weren’t before. With each failed attempt the condition of the Hind worsens. Each day after the first it will take one less success to successfully catch the Hind. After the third day, the Hind succumbs to its wounds and the player characters find its dead body.</p>\n<h2>Treating the Hind</h2>\n<p>Once the player characters catch the hind and are able to treat the Hind’s wounds, they can attempt a <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check</strong> to learn that the Hind is suffering not only from the wound, but also from a poison in her blood. This poison is bound to get worse over time and will kill the Hind if not treated within 3 days. If the Hind is dead, the same check is needed to learn that it was the poison that killed her. If they succeed the skill check by 5 or more, the players are also able to identify the poison: Ettercap Venom.</p>\n<p>The wounds of the Hind can be treated with a charge of a healing kit, potions, or other means that restore hit points. The poison on the other hand needs either the use of the Minor Restoration spell, Lay on Hands, an Antivenom Potion, or an antivenom created from Ettercap Venom with a successful <strong>DC 10 check made</strong> with alchemy tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the player characters should be aware that something inhuman attacked the Hind. With the help of Speak with Animals, they can ask the Hind directly about the events and the attack that happened a few days ago. It is up to the player characters if they want to deal with the Ettercaps or not. After all: they could strike again.</p>\n<h2>Hunting the Ettercaps</h2>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"Gky3ia2spBhzl1sZ\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Ettercaps</a> are a concerning occurrence in the forest, as they are known to defile natural beauty where they find it. If the player characters decide to go after them, a DC 15 (Wisdom) Survival check is needed to track them successfully. They have advantage on this roll if they correctly identified the tracks from the ambush site, as they know what tracks to look for. On a success they find tracks and find the Ettercaps that have invaded the forest (see “Ettercap Nest”). If the Ettercaps are not aware of the player characters and they succeed the skill check by 5 or more, the player characters’ sudden appearance catches the ettercaps by surprise.</p>\n<p>If the skill check fails, the player characters spend an hour lost in the forest and the ettercaps become aware of their presence. If the skill check fails and the ettercaps are already aware of the player characters, the players wander into an ambush of the Ettercaps themselves (see “Ettercap Ambush”).</p>\n<h2>Ettercap Nest</h2>\n<p>The player characters find 4 Ettercaps currently tending to their communal nests, suspended between three trees of the forest. One ettercap is 15 ft. high up on a tree, repairing minor damage to the nest, while the other three are in the process of webbing up a recently killed boar for later consumption. They attack the players as soon as they become aware of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treasure. </strong></em>The Ettercaps collected a few trinkets left behind by their unfortunate victims, including a golden locket worth 100 gp and a small ivory statue carved to resemble a winged angel worth 75 gp. The players are also able to harvest 4 units of Ettercap Venom from the slain monsters. One of the ettercaps wears a strange eye laced in varnish around its neck. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check</strong> successfully identifies this item as the eye of a hag coven.</p>\n<h2>Ettercap Ambush</h2>\n<p>The player characters walk into a web trap set up by the Ettercaps after following the wrong trail. Characters with a passive Perception of 15 or higher notice the trap before it is sprung. If the trap is undetected, each character in the party must make a <strong>DC 13 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or become restrained by the web trap. The web trap functions identically to the web spell, except that it lasts an indeterminate amount of time and requires no concentration. As soon as the players trigger the trap or discover it, the four ettercaps attack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The players are able to harvest 4 units of Ettercap Venom from the slain monsters and find one of the ettercaps carrying the eye of the hag coven (see “Ettercap Nest - Treasure”).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ettercap Venom (Injury)</strong></em>: This poison can be applied to a weapon as an action. For one minute, the weapon deals an additional 1d8 poison damage and when a creature takes this poison damage for the first time in a turn, it must succeed on a <strong>DC 11 Constitution saving throw</strong> or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<h2>Lore: Ettercaps and the Hag</h2>\n<p>In her escape out of the Underworld, Theatralis the hag enlisted the help of the ettercaps, promising them to lead them out of the Underworld in return. Once escaped, Theatralis bestowed upon one of the ettercaps a \"magic trinket\" for protection. In reality the hag gave the ettercap a hag eye she created, so she could use the ettercaps as unwilling scouts as she enacts her sinuous plan. If the players chose to destroy her hag eye, Theatralis will know, but fortunately for the players she will not know it was them, as she was too wrapped up with her current plan to regularly check on the ettercaps.</p>\n<h1>Wrapping Up the Adventure</h1>\n<p>If the players return having rescued the Hind and killed the ettercaps, Aclippe awaits them with a falcon sent by Artemis herself, who is pleased with the characters and bestows upon them a divine boon for their outstanding service — for the next month the characters are aided by the sight of Artemis and make all Survival checks with advantage . If the hind dies but the player characters have dealt with the ettercaps Aclippe rewards them with 500 gp. If the hind dies and the ettercaps have not been dealt with, Aclippe is visibly disappointed and offers nothing.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L03.png"}

Hellbeast Unleashed","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":600000,"flags":{},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>By Alex (TavernTales)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mormo, a vengeful spirit from the Underworld, has possessed one of Chronus's hellbeasts of Tartarus and is using it to run rampage through the Mausoleum of Heroes. In this labor, the characters will receive a first-hand account from a panicked ghost, then quickly travel to the Mausoleum. Once there, they must kill the hellbeast and either negotiate with or eliminate Mormo, who is using her spirit lantern to collect the souls from urns broken by the hellbeast.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>This encounter is best introduced when the characters are resting at the local inn, Lounge Ambrosia. The wailing cries of an anguished spirit rip through the air in Kalogeros and gather the attention of the player characters. A spectral form with a strong jawline, bulging muscles, and a brass helmet bursts into the inn and pleas to the characters for help. \"Our rest is disturbed! It rampages through the halls! The clerics, dead! All will be lost!\" Though the spirit is hysterical, it knows the following information which it communicates to the players if questioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A demon and her pet, a blood-red bull centaur hellbeast wielding a mighty battle-axe, have broken into the mausoleum and begun to smash the urns inside.</li>\n<li>The demon carries a censer that looks to be capturing souls that get released from the smashed urns.</li>\n<li>The clerics of the temple have been killed; the demon and the beast rampage freely through the mausoleum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The spirit is unable to provide further information, eventually devolving into panicked screams and wracking sobs before fleeing the inn. The innkeeper Ghalan, concerningly overhearing this exchange, freely provides the characters with the information contained in the \"Mausoleum of Heroes\"sidebar. Ghalan says that Chiron will surely appreciate their help with this matter and that he can offer as many casks of the finest spirits the gods have to offer as the characters can carry in return for their aid.</p>\n<h2>Lore: The Mausoleum of Heroes</h2>\n<p>There are two reasons for which a soul may be denied passage to the Underworld after death. The first is if they lack the coin to pay Charon for their passage across the River Styx. The others who cannot pass are those who did not receive a proper burial. Without one, they cannot be taken from bank to bank.</p>\n<p>On the outskirts of Kalogeros, the Mausoleum of Heroes holds the spirits of great warriors who were not able to enter the Underworld, often because their bodies could not be recovered or were so mutilated that proper burial was not possible. Rather than be stuck in endless purgatory, souls stored in the urns within the mausoleum are able to rest. Dedicated to Ares, the god of war, and managed by his clerics, the mausoleum is also a frequent pilgrimage site for mortals living below Mount Olympus.</p>\n<h1>Distressed Spirits</h1>\n<p>The Mausoleum is a short journey from the inn, resting at the outskirts of Kalogeros. As the players come within sight of it, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stone steps rise to a low-lying platform upon which the mausoleum of white marble rests. Built out directly from the cliff face, a towering statue of Ares, brightly colored, stands atop its pointed roof. The chaos at the mausoleum is immediately apparent. The east and west walls are crumbled and partially collapsed, and blood stains the grass outside. Distant crashing sounds can be heard emanating from its interior. Suddenly, the spectral forms of two warriors come flying towards you. An ambling, softly pulsing blue light can be seen filtering through the crumbled stone in the west wing. To the east, the sounds of destruction are loud; stomping, crashing, and the scrapings of metal on stone are relentless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"SWKRPXMjx9Nefya5\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Mausoleum Spirits</a> are those of two warriors, forced to flee the temple lest they become captured by Mormo's censer. In their panic, not recognizing the characters as stewards, they falsely believe that the characters are reinforcements of Mormo coming to further destroy the mausoleum. \"Interlopers!\" they cry. \"we cannot allow you to further defile our resting place!\" The spirits can be calmed with a successful <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Persuasion) check</strong>, a Calm Emotions spell, or similar magic. Otherwise, the spirits attack. They use ghost statistics, without the usage of the Horrifying Visage action. The ghosts cannot be destroyed but reducing them to 0 hitpoints causes them to temporarily vanish long enough for the characters to advance forward.</p>\n<p>After the ghosts have been dealt with and the characters reach the mausoleum, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An ambling, softly pulsing blue light can be seen filtering through the crumbled stone in the west wing. To the east, the sounds of destruction are loud; stomping, crashing, and the scrapings of metal on stone are relentless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hellbeast has moved on to the east wing of the mausoleum after leaving the west in ruin. Mormo lingers in the east wing, using her lantern to collect and imprison the souls being released from the broken urns. The characters can enter the mausoleum one of three ways; through the front entrance, or through one of the two crumbling walls leading to the east and west wings. Which wing they enter determines whether they will face Mormo or the hellbeast first.</p>\n<h1>Mormo - West Wing</h1>\n<p>As the characters enter the west wing, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amid the dust and destruction, the hunched form of an old woman is clear. She walks methodically down the hallway while a sack of coin jingles gently at her waist. A censer, glowing with blue light, sways rhythmically in her left hand. Spectral wisps of energy fly through the air, occasionally coalescing around the censer before disappearing. Faint, echoing screams are carried on the air.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The old woman is <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"ciVQY5xbGEyGLRkN\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Mormo</a>, an old enemy of Hera and banished to the Underworld long ago. If confronted by the characters, she is willing to parley and does not immediately attack. She communicates any or all of the following to the characters in a pleasant, sing-song voice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The souls here are imprisoned; they suffer in containment.</li>\n<li>Hera ordered the temple built in honor of her son, Ares. The souls are sacrifices to him.</li>\n<li>She has come to collect them with her censer and is using coins to pay Charon for their passage across the River Styx.</li>\n<li>The souls' suffering will end in the Underworld.</li>\n<li>The hellbeast is one of her \"pets\" from the Underworld.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A character can make a successful <strong>DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> to all but confirm that Mormo is lying, or at best misrepresenting the truth. Mormo in fact hopes to use the souls as fodder for her wars in the Underworld against rival powers in Tartarus, where they will suffer greatly. Mormo does not plan to stay long — she is here only for the souls in the mausoleum and knows that she will soon have to make her escape. The characters can successfully convince her to leave through a successful <strong>DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) or Intimidation check</strong>, wherein she will show them a toothy smile before disappearing using her Etherealness ability. She leaves the hellbeast for the characters to deal with.</p>\n<p>If players enter combat with Mormo while the hellbeast remains alive, she calls out for the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"f5pvT4Jsb2rsnJcr\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Hellbeast</a>, which arrives after two rounds to enter the fray. When she reaches one quarter of her remaining hit points or fewer, she attempts to use her Etherealness ability to disappear, so she may flee from the village of Kalogeros and return to the Underworld with the souls in her censer. Reducing Mormo to 0 hit points banishes her from Mount Olympus and returns her to the Underworld; she leaves behind her sack of coins totalling 100 gp, as well as her censer, Censer of Lost Souls.</p>\n<h1>East Wing - The Hellbeast</h1>\n<p>As the characters enter the east wing, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bodies of temple clerics are sprawled on the floor — their blood turns the stone below a deep red. Stone fragments of urns and smashed statues are everywhere, obscuring the former beauty of the architecture. The air feels almost to vibrate with ethereal energy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the hellbeast has not already been called into combat by Mormo, it is here, continuing to rampage through the hallway, destroying everything in its path. If the characters approach cautiously and roll above the hellbeast’s passive Perception on a group Stealth check, they may catch it by surprise. The hellbeast is in a rage and cannot be reasoned with. It fights until it is destroyed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cleric Platon.</strong> </em>Cleric Platon, an elderly member of the clergy, is hiding behind a stone altar at the north end of this wing. After seeing his fellow clerics be slaughtered by the beast, he panicked and hid, seeing it as his only chance at survival. If the hellbeast charges in this direction during combat, Platon's location may be revealed. If so, he enters initiative, though he is unarmed and seeks only to avoid the hellbeast on his turn.</p>\n<h1>Resolution</h1>\n<p>Whether or not Mormo has been killed or simply driven off, the mausoleum is saved. If Cleric Platon survived, he rushes out from hiding (if he has not done so already) and introduces himself to the characters, thanking them profusely. In a more formal expression of gratitude, Platon takes them before the statue of Ares in the mausoleum's central wing and grants them the Blessing of Ares. Chiron will then summon them to his villa and pay them 2000 gp for their service.</p>\n<p>If Cleric Platon did not survive, the rest of the village will soon hear of the characters' heroics regardless. Chiron summons them to his villa and grants them the 2000 gp reward.</p>\n<h2>The Blessing of Ares</h2>\n<p>Creatures that receive the blessing of the god of war are granted a permanent +1 increase to their Strength score.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L07.png"}

She has slain many worshipers in the goddess's temple and has filled it with bloodthirsty birds that flock to her defense. In this labor, the characters will need to investigate the temple of Artemis and remove the birds and harpy from the temple in order for her followers to congregate safely once again.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Chiron speaks of another problem that has arisen on Mount Olympus. Artemis, goddess of the hunt, is concerned about the state of worship in her temple. She has sensed a steep decline in prayers to her over the past months. The temple is not far from Kalogeros; the Head Steward gives the characters directions to get to it so they can investigate.</p>\n<h2>The Harpy's Story</h2>\n<p>A few months earlier, a harpy escaped from the underworld. She was once part of a coven of harpies that terrorized the mortal world. Eventually a group of Artemis's worshipers, blessed by the goddess, hunted down the coven and sent them all to Hades. The harpy sought revenge on Artemis for her defeat and has taken residence in Artemis's temple on Mount Olympus. Her foul presence has stirred up scores of birds from the Stymphalian swamp below the mountain, causing them to leave their natural habitat in the trees of Olympus and swarm the temple. The harpy's magic has also caused the birds to have an unnatural bloodlust and aggression towards people.</p>\n<p>At first the harpy infiltrated the temple by dubbing herself the Wings of Artemis while hiding under a cloak hoping to lure worshipers away from the goddess, ceasing prayers to her and thus weakening her. The harpy attempted to sway the followers of Artemis to worship herself, but the ruse failed and her evil form was revealed. A battle ensued in which the harpy slaughtered the worshipers and hid their bodies in the offering room of the temple.</p>\n<h1>The Temple Approach</h1>\n<p>The temple was built in honor of the goddess of the hunt, Artemis; its design reflects the goddess's beauty and strength. The temple was frequently visited during the day by worshipers. Over the last few days hardly any worshipers have been seen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A temple of marble and stone stands proudly on a flagstone promenade. Golden statues of two women clad in armor holding spears flank the southern wall facing a large pond. Currently the most notable feature is a large swarm of small birds that are roosting on the temple roof and around its court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Birds.</strong></em> Six <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"pT6PeVZRjo0eSUQS\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Swarm of Stymphalian Birds</a> that have been roosting on and around the temple attack the characters as they arrive. There is no feasible way to pass to the temple undetected by the flocks of birds aside from teleportation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Statues.</strong></em> There are four statues on the outside of the temple: two statues on the south side and two on the north. They all contain clues to opening the treasury. The pairs of statues have inscriptions on their bases, the left statues have engraved: <em>boldly</em>, while the right statues state: <em>beautiful</em>.</p>\n<h2>Boat Dock</h2>\n<p>To the south of the temple is a small dock with a boat tied to it. The boat is 10-feet long by 4-feet wide with AC 11 and 50 hit points. It also has immunity to poison and psychic damage. Treasure. Inside the boat is a potion of greater healing in a dusty bottle wrapped in tattered sheepskin.</p>\n<h2>Outer Hall</h2>\n<p>This hall is open to the outside and is covered by the temple's roof that is held up by several pillars. It contains two doors facing east and west leading to the temple's prayer hall and temple treasury, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Prayer Hall</h2>\n<p>This hall is the sanctum where worshipers come to pay tribute and pray to the goddess Artemis. Its doors are unlocked and slightly ajar, the chirping of birds can be heard from within.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You smell the sweet inviting scent of incense as you enter the inner temple. Up above, the temple's ceilings soar 30- feet above in order to accommodate a 20-foot tall statue of a female warrior: the goddess Artemis herself. You suddenly hear angry shrieks and the mad flapping of wings as a flock of birds descend on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Six more swarms of stymphalian birds attack the characters as soon as they enter the chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure.</strong> At the foot of the statue is a spread of offerings to Artemis including: 6 arrows, an ornate dagger worth 25gp, 3 wineskins of wine and 30gp in coins. These items are an offering to the goddess and bestow a curse on anyone who takes them, see Curse of Artemis.</p>\n<h2>Temple Treasury</h2>\n<p>This room holds the gold and treasure offered to Artemis in order to gain her favor for successful hunting. The doors to this room are locked and can only be opened with the phrase boldly beautiful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strong smell of death washes over you as you enter this room. A pile of bodies lies on the floor in front of you. There are a series of shelves on the room's walls on which you see dozens of glittering objects: offerings to the goddess of the hunt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Bodies.</strong></em> The bodies here are a mix of stewards that tended to the temple and worshipers of Artemis. There are 13 bodies in all. A visual inspection shows deep claw marks on the bodies. Upon a successful <strong>DC 13 medicine (Wisdom) check</strong> a character can discern that some of the bodies have been here for as long as a month and others as little as a day or two.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure. </strong>The items that can be found on the treasury shelves are: three gold plated jars worth 25gp each, a hammered steel spear and buckler set decorated with images of bulls worth 100gp each, a marble bust of a young hunter worth 25gp, six white ceramic dishes and six ceramic goblets worth 10gp each, and five coffers containing 50gp in coins. The total value of the treasure is 460gp. These items are subject to the Curse of Artemis if removed, additionally there is a 40% chance the buyer of these articles recognizes the pieces as offerings from the temple and refuses to buy.</p>\n<h2>Roof</h2>\n<p>The characters will need some way to access the roof, whether by flight, grappling hook or climbing trees. Once they arrive, the characters see the roof is lively with many birds swarming around their nests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Five nests are perched on the roof, and dozens of birds swarm around them. A hag-like figure covered in feathers is hunched over one of the nests eating the raw eggs inside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are four swarms of stymphalian birds along with the harpy who calls herself Wings of Artemis. The birds that are present don't attack until the harpy orders them to do so. When the characters arrive the harpy is distracted with a nest on the opposite side of the roof from the character's entry.</p>\n<h1>Wings of Artemis</h1>\n<p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"elxbNIVGf7it5hhJ\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Wings of Artemis</a> is a harpy that despises the goddess Artemis and has recently escaped the underworld (see background section). She has a strong craving for raw bird's eggs and spends a lot of time eating them from the nests on the roof. The harpy attacks as soon as the characters are spotted. Once she is down to 10 hit points or fewer she attempts to fly away and escape.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Once the Wings of Artemis has been defeated all the bird swarms around the temple retreat in <a class=\"inline-roll gmroll\" title=\"Days\" data-mode=\"gmroll\" data-flavor=\"Days\" data-formula=\"1d4\"><i class=\"fas fa-dice-d20\"></i> 1d4</a> days. They build new nests out on Lake Stymphalia.</p>\n<h2>Reward</h2>\n<p>If the characters kill the Wings of Artemis and did not steal any treasure from the temple, Artemis visits the characters within a day. Her avatar has the appearance of a bright glowing maiden in full armor wielding a shield and longsword. The maiden thanks the characters for their bravery in defeating the harpy and for their honesty in her temple. She bestows a gift of 500 gp in coins.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L06a.png"}

The Stewards of Olympus, after hearing of their most recent heroics and needing help to quell the Underworld incursion, decide that they may be worthy candidates to become champions of the gods.</p>\n<p>An aasimar messenger from Olympus greets the characters and summons them to a meeting with Chiron at Lounge Ambrosia in Kalogeros. The messenger is cryptic about the exact reason why; explaining only that the gods are looking to make new champions and that the village of Kalogeros has a serious problem it needs help dealing with. The messenger freely shares any information in the \"The Stewards of Olympus\"and \"The Village of Kalogeros\" sections. If the characters are unfamiliar with the route to Kalogeros, the messenger will happily escort them.</p>\n<p>Once they arrive at Lounge Ambrosia, Chiron explains the full nature of their quest and provides the information found in the \"The Underworld and the Cycle of Cerberus\" section. The characters are welcome to free lodging at the Lounge for the entirety of their stay in the village.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gamemaster Note: Text formatted in this way is meant to be read aloud to the players.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Stewards of Olympus</h2>\n<p>The vast tracts of land that comprise Mount Olympus must be tended to, and the gods themselves certainly have no time for such busywork. The Stewards of Olympus are those with the authority, delegated by the gods themselves, to ensure that their divine home remains in pristine condition. Supernatural beings or simply mortals that answered to a higher calling, the Stewards themselves are as varied as their tasks. The celestial orchards require pruning, the horses demand grooming, and the wilds must be preserved for hunting. Mount Olympus is both home and playground for Zeus and his companions; its maintenance is crucial. Lead by the centaur Chiron, the Head Steward, the Stewards of Olympus also serve as intermediaries between the gods and the mortal races; delivering messages, helping to fulfill prophecies, and safeguarding Olympus from those who would dare penetrate its hallowed veil.</p>\n<h2>The Underworld and the Cycle of Cerberus</h2>\n<p>At the base of Olympus lie the shrouded gates to the Underworld. The near proximity of the Great Above and the Deep Below is no coincidence, for Hades and Zeus prefer to keep watchful eyes on each other. This convenience of geography, however, can occasionally prove problematic. It is the nature of the Underworld to suck away the life and vitality of nearly all its servants and the thrice-headed hound is no different—the cycle of Cerberus has come to its end. After untold years protecting the entrance to Hades and incensed by the blood of a demigod, he has grown too feral and savage, tearing apart the essences of the damned as they rightly try to shuffle off their mortal coils or ignoring escaping souls entirely. Denizens of the Underworld, either with axes to grind or having simply a proclivity for pandemonium, have begun to overwhelm the Mountain. Free from Cerberus' supervision, they have flooded up the slopes and wrought havoc in their wake. The gods themselves are none too concerned; this kind of thing happens every few millennia. It is the Stewards who are tasked with dealing with this annoyance. But the Stewards could certainly use the help, and what better opportunity to create champions of the mortal races?</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L0.png"}
{"_id":"Q8GgkIvPuZdjD8Je","name":"A2. The Village of Kalogeros","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":200000,"flags":{},"content":"<p>Kalogeros is a small village named for the peak it was built on. Almost as old as the gods themselves, Zeus worked closely with @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.zf4tLE5NHQLrz4ut]{Chiron} to ensure that the Stewards would have everything they needed to perform their divine duties. It is said that at the right time of day, its marbled, illuminated architecture reflects the sunlight so radiantly that the village can be seen from the base of Mount Olympus. For this reason, the village is also sometimes referred to as the Pearl of the Mountain. Loosely clustered domiciles, temples, and assemblies are surrounded by sprawling fruit orchards, farmsteads, and the encompassing wilderness.</p>\n<h2>Chiron's Dwelling</h2>\n<p>Chiron lives in a sparkling villa of white marble built upon a narrow plateau that overlooks the village below. Chiron is one of the few Stewards who is immortal, so his villa is stocked with amenities such as bathing pools, a library, multiple flower gardens, and a conservatory to help occupy his time.</p>\n<p>Chiron is a centaur; the first of his kind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: Chiron stands just over seven feet tall, towering over most of the mortal races. He is barechested, wearing only a thick leather apron and the rest of his dazzling jewelry, including multiple rings, earrings, and bracelets. His face looks wise and slightly weathered, and he often bears a soft grin.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: It is Chiron's duty to oversee the other Stewards, and to protect and maintain Kalogeros and the entirety of Mount Olympus. Chiron hopes to see the prosperity of both the Mountain itself and all of creation under the charge of the gods.</li>\n<li><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Chiron is measured in his speech, almost slow. He is kind and seeks to be helpful, but understands that sometimes lessons are best learned on one's own. He often takes pride in mentoring worthy pupils of the mortal races, offering kernels of his wisdom gained through an infinite lifetime of direct servitude to the gods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Orchard</h2>\n<p>Along the outskirts of Kalogeros, far from the main road, great stone walls veil an apple orchard. Glimpsing through the magnificent bronze gates the sight is more akin to a forest with narrow winding paths rather than neat and orderly rows. The trees’ canopy builds toward the center, as the trees get older and older, forming a low hill of deep green. With help from the gods the interior space far exceeds the space granted by the walls, done to hide a little known present from Hera.</p>\n<p>Thales is a female centaur, Chiron’s daughter, and guardian to the hidden golden apple tree within the orchard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: Even without her polished silver and bronze breastplate and gauntlets, she stands as an imposing-looking centaur. Never far from her glaive, the toned muscles of her arms are proof enough she is well trained in its use. Her skin is dark and slightly weathered from a life spent in the sun and her hair is almost the definition of copper.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: Thales has been appointed by Hera herself to protect the tree of golden apples, only allowing those she deems worthy to even attempt retrieving one. She views this as her great purpose in life, though still longs to see sights far beyond the orchard’s walls.</li>\n<li><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Thales is regarded as quiet and sometimes distant. She takes time to consider not only her words, but the words of those presented to her and how they are presented. While her decisions take time to be measured, once made they are cemented in her mind, and any trust given is held ferociously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lounge Ambrosia</h2>\n<p>Kalogeros has but a single inn, for travelers are not frequent in the land of the gods. Lounge Ambrosia mostly serves as a place of rest and gathering for the stewards of the village. The interior resembles a sort of opulent mess hall, with long mahogany tables, ever-roaring hearths, curtains of fine silk, and pieces of priceless art from across the world. The food served here is said to be eaten by the gods themselves. The lounge is kept by Ghalan Ashworthy, who won ownership of the inn in a bet against Daphnis, son of Hermes.</p>\n<p>Ghalan is a male halfling, who was granted sanctuary in Kalogeros after rescuing Daphnis from a spot of trouble. •</p>\n<p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Ghalan is middle-aged for a halfling, with a bald head and brown eyes. His skin is rugged and sunburned from a long history of farming. The boots he wears — a gift from Hermes — are embroidered with strands of gold. •</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations</strong>: Ghalan never forgets how lucky he is to be mingling with the divine on Mount Olympus. He wishes to learn the story of every Steward in the village and knows it will be a long time before he perfects the recipes of ambrosia himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Ghalan is affectionate and jovial, and is very quick to make friends. Charismatic and quick-witted, Ghalan can often cause the patrons of Lounge Ambrosia to erupt in laughter due to a well-timed quip. He loves any games of chance, never turning down an invitation to wager.</p>\n<h2>Amarysia Lodge</h2>\n<p>On the outskirts of Kalogeros, Amarysia Lodge stands to accommodate the numerous Stewards that hunt on Mount Olympus, who help to feed the village and maintain local wildlife populations. Dedicated to Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, those who spend the night there may find that their arrows fly truer the next day. A small pond beside the lodge holds fish of all shapes and colors which are kept fed by</p>\n<p>Aclippe, a ranger and keeper of the lodge. Aclippe is a female elf ranger who has lived on Mount Olympus for centuries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: Aclippe has long, curly black hair that contrasts sharply with her bright blue eyes. She stands over six feet tall and always keeps her bow at her side. New acquaintances often accuse her natural resting face for annoyance, but this is often misguided.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: Aclippe is happy to spend her days on her usual hunts and routines, including caring for the fish in the pond beside the lodge, where she tends to meditate. Though she one day believes she will leave Mount Olympus for new experiences, today is not that day. Nor is tomorrow.</li>\n<li><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Aclippe speaks without enthusiasm or much inflection, helping to contribute to her sometimes poor first impressions. Once someone gets to know Aclippe, however, her goodness of heart is made clear. Aclippe is always true to her word and fiercely defends her convictions. When she is deep in thought, she often twirls a finger absent-mindedly through her hair.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thyrsus Vineyard</h2>\n<p>The Thyrsus Vineyard is a sprawling vineyard on the western end of Kalogeros. Its grounds also host an outdoor theatre where stewards or privileged foreign performers are invited to put on shows for the village. Songbirds linger around the grape vines, singing a constant melody.</p>\n<p>Gregorios, the vineyard owner, lives in a villa on the estate. Gregorios is a male satyr who became friends with Dionysus after a party many years ago.</p>\n<p>Appearance: Gregorios is tall and stocky, with long brown hair and a crooked smile. His hooves are polished to a dull shine. He wears a specially-fitted white tunic bedazzled with small gems and precious stones.</p>\n<p>Motivations: In addition to tending to the vineyard, Gregorios is an avid reader and generous patron of the arts. He wants to get his hands on as many books and pieces of art as he can; the rarer and more prized the better.</p>\n<p>Mannerisms and Personality: Gregorios is highly empathetic, and can make almost anyone he speaks to feel as if they are the only person in the world. Many find the sound of his voice soothing. His interest in literature and history means he can often provide bits of knowledge that prove helpful in the right situation. He loves scarves, and cycles through his colorful collection daily.</p>\n<h2>The Cap and Hammer</h2>\n<p>The Cap and Hammer smithy hosts a forge blessed by Hephaestus himself. Though the weapons and armor crafted here are not quite fit for the gods themselves, they come as close as any other forge in the world. Its exterior walls are decorated with intricate relief carvings depicting the history of Hephaestus' exile and eventual return to Mount Olympus. The Cap and Hammer is operated by Artemisia, the village blacksmith.</p>\n<p>Artemisia is a young woman famous in some mortal circles for her skills as a smith.</p>\n<p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Artemisia is dark-skinned, with long, braided black hair and piercing dark eyes. Her left leg below the knee was amputated for medical reasons when she was very young; she wears a bronze prosthetic she crafted for herself, which she continually makes improvements to over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations</strong>: Artemisia hopes one day to become as skilled as Hephaestus, so that she may be offered the chance to craft a weapon for Athena. She ensures that The Cap and Hammer is always remarkably clean and tidy, keeping everything in its place.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Artemisia takes the utmost pride in her work and will never allow herself to hand over anything she is not completely satisfied with. She speaks matter-of-factly, never hesitating to offer her input if she feels its what people need to hear. She is fond of animals, usually preferring them over people. Her cat, Kimbo, is often by her side.</p>\n<h2>Temple to Zeus</h2>\n<p>Built officially to honor Zeus, small shrines to the rest of the pantheon can also be found in this renowned temple. The double-porched building is constructed entirely of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade on all sides. Its friezes are carved with heroic depictions of the gods and are painted red, blue, and black. Inside, sunlight filters through deliberate holes in the ceiling to bathe the interior with light. The temple is managed by Paeon, the village hierophant.</p>\n<p>Paeon is a male aasimar, who was birthed by Zeus to serve the village.</p>\n<p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Paeon has chalk-white skin, long golden hair, and eyes of solid silver. He stands at just over seven feet tall, and wears a breastplate of polished steel over a cream-colored tunic. He carries a bejeweled war-glaive at his side. His face is hard and emotionless.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations</strong>: Paeon's primary job is to coordinate worship of the gods on Mount Olympus, which he carries out with unthinking loyalty. He also has been gifted with the power of divine healing, which he uses for the benefit of the village. Paeon hopes to one day ascend to the heights of Mount Olympus to live with the gods themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms and Personality</strong>: Paeon is almost robotic in his speech patterns, for Zeus wanted to create a servant of almost machine-like efficiency. His voice is supernaturally deep and echoes slightly, regardless of his environment. Paeon is personally unfeeling, but is fiercely committed to justice and always acts in accordance with the will of the gods (Zeus specifically).</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L0.png"}

Unable to find them in his investigations, he did discover the stable is now inaccessible for some reason, having been sealed shut from the inside.</p>\n<p>The party will learn a strange type of ooze has been drawn to the stable and is attempting to take it as their own to feed on the abundance of refuse. Strangely, the stablehands have been kept alive and the animals are all well looked after, all of which is part of a ploy for the augean inside to grow stronger, smarter, and deadlier.</p>\n<h1>Trouble is Brewing</h1>\n<p>As it will become relevant later, it is important to set the atmosphere: the weather is gloomy and the air is thick with moisture. Those who know the signs can see rain will soon be overhead.</p>\n<p>Chiron wastes no time in approaching the characters with his worries; two members of the Stewards have gone missing. Both were stablehands, and it is surely no coincidence the stable doors are now sealed from the inside. With the Steward’s livestock and some of the gods’ treasured creatures within, it is important that any dangers in the stable are disposed of. Chiron will also convey the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both stable hands were last seen two days ago.</li>\n<li>The stable hold 30 cows, two war rhinoceros’, a pegasus, and a one-horned horse.</li>\n<li>Chiron will offer a cow to each party member as a reward, or 100 gold instead of a cow if preferred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even without evidence, Chiron can sense something malicious within the stable and warns the characters to be on their guard.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Augeans</h2>\n<p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"gUzfXFRp0Kvov9DU\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Augeans</a> are oozes unique to the underworld, typically preying on wayward spirits or souls but when necessary still capable of consuming the same wastes as a regular ooze. What makes them unique is their capacity for intelligence. As they feed, they grow, and as this happens they get smarter.</p>\n<p>One such creature has managed to escape the underworld and found their way into the stable at Kalogeros. While it did not find spirits to feed on, it did find a more than sufficient replacement — the wastes of divine creatures. Once it gained enough mass, it conspired to keep this buffet for itself, sapping the spirits of the stablehands to create helpers in the form of young augeans to help look after the beasts and collect its food. It will not give up the decadent lifestyle it has created for itself without a fight.</p>\n<h2>Stable Exterior</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This massive construction of ancient wood not only shows signs of being well cared for, but of importance and stature too. A stone foundation holds tightly to thick beams of dark wood inlaid with carvings of mythological creatures, the sumptuous double doors are sturdy enough for a keep, and the arched roof shows glistening gilding around its edges as well as on the rims of large dormers that run along either side to provide airflow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The doors have been sealed with ooze residue, acting like a tough glue. Any characters with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 15, or who succeed on a <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> will notice some of it pushing through the cracks and seeping through the bottom of the doors.</p>\n<p>Water can dissolve this substance, requiring approximately a gallon to be carefully poured between the cracks and allowing the doors to be opened again.</p>\n<p>Forcing the doors open requires a <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>, which on a success cracks and shatters the solidified ooze. Alternatively the characters can attack the doors or wooden walls with slashing weapons, which will take one creature approximately 1 hour to make a hole large enough for a medium creature to step through. This time can be cut in half for each character contributing. Despite the noise, this method of entry doesn’t draw attention from the Augeans within as it is beyond their blindsight radius.</p>\n<p>Another option for entry are the dormers along the roof, which have openings big enough to fit a medium creature. Climbing up the 20 feet to reach the roof unaided requires a <strong>DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. The DC can be reduced to 12 by using the engravings within the pillars as footholds, or using a rope with a grappling hook. Dropping down into the stable takes them into the central path, and within the blindsight radius of the young augean in Area 2.</p>\n<h2>Stable Interior</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A subtle odor of decay pricks at your senses before being swept away. A soft orchestra of various animal sounds fill the air as light taps of rain begin to peck at the roof. While the dormers above provide good airflow, they do little to light the space within. Before you is a main aisle of mud, flanked by rows of wooden stalls. By the main doors, and in the middle of each row of stalls, almost completely obscured by shadows, are paths which split off further into the stable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/artwork/StablesLocations.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>All of the stalls, except for the northwest corner stall and the six stalls closest to the doors, house one or two cattle within each of them. The three stalls north of the doors house a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"uF2c5cBqlzQ6LTnl\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Unicorn</a>, a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"XSxbvcKJKmYiZjVJ\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Pegasus</a>, and one <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"5IKxj2Dn2SrfigQQ\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Rhinoceros</a>. Of the south stalls only one is occupied, which houses another rhinoceros.</p>\n<p>Examining any of the stalls with a successful <strong>DC 8 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> shows that the animals seem well cared for — there is food and some water provided, and each stall is mostly mucked out and cleaned.</p>\n<p>Prior to the characters arriving, the northwest corner stall (Area 3) contains within it an <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"gUzfXFRp0Kvov9DU\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Adult Augean</a>. It is being tended to by a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"7USYqeMpTt6qyFyH\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Young Augean</a>, who is feeding it the collected animal filth from the stalls. Another young augean is mucking out the cattle stall towards the back wall by the main aisle (Area 2).</p>\n<h3><strong>1. The Main Doors</strong></h3>\n<p>The back of the stable doors are almost completely covered with a purple crystalline substance, which not only sealed the entryway shut but has also encased the two stablehands and adhered them to the doors. If a character succeeds on a <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Medicine) check</strong> on the bodies, they will learn that though both are unconscious, they are still alive.</p>\n<p>A character that succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check</strong> on the crystalline substance will learn it is the remains of an ooze-like creature.</p>\n<p>If the characters attempt to free the stablehands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking each stablehand free requires dealing a total of 20 bludgeoning, slashing, force, or thunder damage to the structure surrounding the individual stablehand.</li>\n<li>Both young augeans will investigate and attack, as they can sense their connection being severed.</li>\n<li>The augeans will focus on the characters attempting to damage the crystal structure, or those standing closest to it.</li>\n<li>For each stablehand released, an augean is immediately reduced to sludge and attempts to slither back to the adult augean and rejoin with it. It has a movement speed of 20. Otherwise it fights to the death.</li>\n<li>Once freed, the stablehands remain unconscious for 3d6 hours or until a lesser restoration spell is cast on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Distressed Cattle</strong></h3>\n<p>Whines and moans of a distressed cow echo out from this enclosure. The stall appears to have been in the process of being cleaned out. A bucket of waste has been laid by the gate and the feed has been freshly filled.</p>\n<p>If the young augean tending to the stall has not already been prompted to investigate the arrival of the party, and characters have not made efforts to conceal their presence or their <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) check was lower than a DC 20</strong>, the creature notices them once they come within 30 feet of the stall. Otherwise it will confront the party once their presence is revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its first priority is to exit the stall and seal it before confronting the characters so as not to hurt or scare the animal during combat —drawing the characters out first if necessary.</li>\n<li>The creature has enough intelligence to focus on the character who deals the most damage.</li>\n<li>Once it reaches 10 hit points it will attempt to retreat to Area 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Characters who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> or <strong>DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> of the area will notice the start of a faint trail of muck and amorphous tracks which lead from here to Area 3.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Adult Augean's Stall</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rain above begins its assault on the roof in full force now, filling the air inside with a constant low rumble. A distinct scent of refuse increases as you approach the far corner, towards the remains of a stall. Its doors and low walls seem to have been eaten away, and the edges coated with a thick bead of purple crystal. Peering inside, a bubbling mass of purple ooze slithers up the walls, forming the vague silhouette of a large humanoid. Suddenly the walls around the mass shake and tremble, their deep reverberations echoing out as words: “You are not welcome here!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the characters did not attempt to free the stablehands in Area 1 and defeat the young augeans sent to defend them, one young augean will also be here, previously feeding buckets of collected muck to the large mass.</p>\n<p>The mass of ooze here is the adult augean. As an intelligent creature, it is aware the party is likely here to destroy it or deny it its luxurious buffet. Capable of speech, it will attempt to intimidate the party into leaving by speaking of its immense strength and ability to consume both mortal flesh and spiritual essence — death at its hands will mean no afterlife for them.</p>\n<p>If the augean feels its words are not being taken seriously, or if it is attacked by the party, the following happens: Defending its new found home, the adult augean fights to the death, focusing on the party member who deals the most damage, or those capable of healing. Aware of the impending roof collapse covered in the next section, towards the end of its life it will attempt to use its abilities to restrain the party so that hopefully the roof may take them out even if it perishes.</p>\n<h2>Last One Standing</h2>\n<p>Without the corner pillar’s support and due to increased weight from the rain, the roof is beginning to collapse. When it does, it will cover an area inside the stable of about 45 feet away from the corner - represented on map 5.1 as highlighted in gray. The characters will have 10 minutes before the collapse.</p>\n<p>If the characters wish to evacuate some of the cattle, each animal requires a <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check</strong> and 1 minute to move to a safe distance. For every character helping to move the same animal, the DC reduces by 4. A failed check results in 1 minute of lost time.</p>\n<p>Any creatures caught within the collapse can make a <strong>DC 20 Dexterity saving throw</strong>, taking <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"Bludgeoning Damage\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"Bludgeoning Damage\" data-formula=\"9d6\"><i class=\"fas fa-dice-d20\"></i> 9d6</a> bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.</p>\n<h1>Collecting the Reward</h1>\n<p>Once the task is done, Chiron pays for the agreed upon reward, but will pay an additional 1000 gp total if the party was able to rescue the stablehands. If the stablehands were not discovered, they will be found and recovered by the stewards the following day as repairs are being made.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L05.png"}
{"_id":"inYYeWEiQZLupn6s","name":"L10. Bakchos and the Ettin","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":900000,"flags":{},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>By Alex from Tavern Tales</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A hill giant named @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.B2pCiVMcHSvQEPJy]{Bakchos} who was banished to the Underworld for disobeying Zeus has returned, and is slaughtering the red cattle he was once tasked with keeping, seeking to bring the prized beef back to the Underworld. He has manipulated his ettin friend, who once tended the cattle with him, into helping him. In this labor, the characters will have to deal with the imps that Bakchos brought with him from Tartarus before they can deal with the ettin or the hill giant himself, who have holed up in the barn to slaughter the red cattle.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The ettin who tends to the red cattle of Zeus has not returned to the village in some time. Alkaios and Zilia (the left and right heads) had become popular with the locals for their goodnatured bickering that could be heard during their weekly shopping trips for produce and other supplies. With everything else that has gone on, Chiron suspects that something may have happened. He tells the party that Alkaios and Zilia are impressionable and scare easily, and fears that they may be in danger. If the characters ask for more information or one character makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine that Chiron knows more than he lets on, Chiron provides the information in the \"Bakchos and The Ettin\" sidebar. Though he is hesitant to say it, for he has no evidence, he considers it a strong possibility that Bakchos has returned to the farm, angry about his banishment from the Mountain.</p>\n<h2>Lore: Bakchos and the Ettin</h2>\n<p>Zeus is notorious for his escapades into the material realms and his fraternizing with the mortal races. One such adventure led him to the caves of Bakchos the hill giant and Alkaios and Zilia, the ettin, where the pair tended to a small flock of sheep. The ettin and the hill giant were a bonded pair, and Zeus found great pleasure in performing \"magic tricks\" for the curious creatures, who were amazed by his divine presentations. Over many visits, Zeus became quite charmed by their inquisitive nature, their simple sense of humor, and their penchant for juvenile shenanigans. After becoming friends, Zeus offered them a permanent home on Mount Olympus itself, so that he could visit more frequently. Like their sheep, they were to tend to Zeus' prized herd of red cattle, on one condition: the cattle were to be slaughtered only for special occasions; when Zeus himself explicitly allowed it. For a time, the situation was a prosperous one. But there came a day, despite the warnings of Alkaios and Zilia, that Bakchos grew too curious. Hungering for the divine beef of the red cattle, Bakchos slaughtered one of the animals for himself. Zeus, furious, banished Bakchos to Tartarus of the Underworld and warned Alkaios and Zilia that should any of his cattle ever be disrespected again, the ettin would be next to go.</p>\n<h1>Infernal Rodeo</h1>\n<p>The farm lies in the middle of a small valley, separated from the village by three miles of lightly-forested ground. Just before they reach the valley clearing, characters with a passive Perception of 12 or higher can hear the distant sounds of struggle in the brush; muffled voices interrupted by a distinct mooing. Two tartarus imps are wrangling a red cow that had escaped while Bakchos and the imps were herding it into the barn. The imps are fastening a lasso around the creature and intend to lead it back to Bakchos for slaughter.</p>\n<p>If confronted, the imps are hostile to the party but do not attack unless threatened. Imlix, the de facto leader of the group, speaks for them. If given the chance, Imlix communicates any or all of the following information to the party:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bakchos, a fierce hill giant, has led their escape from Tartarus</li>\n<li>They are here to slaughter the red cattle and bring the beef back to the underworld</li>\n<li>Bakchos and the Ettin know each other somehow</li>\n<li>The Ettin was hesitant to help, but Bakchos convinced it to join their cause</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Imlix or any of the other imps realize that the characters intend to stop Bakchos, they attempt to flee back to the farm at the first opportunity so that they can warn him.</p>\n<h1>The Ettin</h1>\n<p>As the characters clear the forest and look out into the small valley below, read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sloping rock walls give way to a lush field of green grass, bisected by a lazily-flowing river that pours down from a small waterfall in the rock face nearby. A fence wraps around the field and leads to a large barn constructed of polished mahogany. A plume of black smoke can be seen pouring from an open upper-level window. At the northern barn doors, an ettin wielding a greatclub nervously stands guard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.Ydd9KWuIFA5q7ErN]{Alkaios and Zilia}&nbsp;are guarding the entrance to the barn on behalf of Bakchos and the imps who are quickly working to slaughter as many cattle as they can. The ettin does not attack unless the characters act hostile or otherwise attempt to enter the barn. How the characters access the barn is up to them. They may attack the ettin head-on and enter the barn through the front door, though the ettin's death will make Chiron unhappy. Alternatively, they may attempt to sneak past the ettin and enter the barn through the loft, which requires a successful <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong> opposed by a <strong>Wisdom (Perception) roll</strong> by the ettin. Alternatively, Alkaios and Zilia may be negotiated with.</p>\n<p>Negotiation with the ettin is difficult, and requires tailored approaches when conversing with each head. If the characters learned the information in the \"Backchos and The Ettin\"sidebar, they can use this to their advantage in negotiations.</p>\n<p>Alkaios is the more headstrong of the duo, and believes that Zeus got bored of their company and stopped visiting them. Zilia is timid and less sure of the slaughtering than Alkaios, but still likes Bakchos and believes that his punishment from Zeus was far too harsh.</p>\n<p><strong>Wisdom (Persuasion) checks</strong> to convince the headstrong Alkaios to give up the cause are made with advantage. Conversely, <strong>Strength or Charisma (Intimidation) checks</strong> against Alkaios are made with disadvantage. <strong>The reverse is true for the timid Zilia</strong>. Persuading each head requires a successful check of 12 or higher. Characters may make more than a single attempt, but any failure by 5 or more results in permanently angering the head.</p>\n<p>If the characters successfully convince both heads, Alkaios and Zilia may join the characters fight to defeat Bakchos and his imps, sending them back to the Underworld.</p>\n<p>If the characters fail to convince either head, the ettin attacks the characters.</p>\n<p>If the characters convince one head but not the other, the heads begin to argue with each other, eventually throwing punches and headbutts as the ettin loses all interest in the characters in a heap of self-directed fury.</p>\n<h1>Bakchos and the Barn</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The smell of firewood and cooking meat fills the nostrils, courtesy of a large bonfire that fills the building with dark smoke. Butchered animal remains are piled into heaps and more litter the floor. Large, bulging burlap sacks are soaked through with blood and stacked along the southern wall. Dozens of red cattle, herded into stalls, moo repeatedly in distress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bakchos and the imps work quickly to butcher and bag the meat for transport, but they couldn't resist cooking some of it up to enjoy immediately, hence the bonfire. @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.B2pCiVMcHSvQEPJy]{Bakchos} and six @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.Q4KYEJB3jsC5kh5T]{Tartarus Imps} are present here. They attack the characters as soon as they notice them, immediately recognizing them as intruders. If the characters snuck into the barn, the sounds of combat alert the ettin outside, who joins the fray after one round.</p>\n<p>The stall doors containing the red cattle are closed with a simple latch. If opened, the panicked cattle run free and push right through the barn doors. Any creatures standing between the stall and the barn doors when the latch is opened must make a successful <strong>DC 18 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or take [[/roll 5d8 # Bludgeoning Damage]] bludgeoning damage and fall prone as the cattle trample over them to escape.</p>\n<h1>Resolution</h1>\n<p>Killing Bakchos and the imps returns their souls to the Underworld. If Alkaios and Zilia survived, whether they helped the characters fight Bakchos or not, they realize the error of their ways and that they were misled by Bakchos. Though the ettin is still disappointed that Zeus has visited them less in recent times, they communicate their plans to travel to the village and apologize to Chiron for what they allowed to happen.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L10.png"}

The Horses of Diomedes","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":700000,"flags":{},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>By Thai (@metal_and_magic)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the last few days villagers have taken ill and subsequently died. With a third villager now unable to wake up, our heroes are called for.</p>\n<p>The once man-eating mares of Diomedes are jumping between hosts and between dreams, chasing their former cruel master, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"K2g3MlWtLsfKoaaE\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Diomedes</a>, who has escaped the underworld to terrorize the Stewards of Olympus. The party must find a common link between the victims to discover a connection to the mares of Diomedes, before obtaining a special flower which may help the third victim. Finally the true scope is realised when the characters enter the dream world to find Diomedes causing chaos, rather than the horses.</p>\n<h1>An Illness Spreads</h1>\n<p>Chiron asks the party to meet him at a house on the edge of the vineyard. From a balcony the Head Steward waves the party up a set of exterior stairs, and guides them inside.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Light spills in through vast windows overlooking the vineyard. Vases stuffed with bright smelling flowers mask an odor of sweat and a sprawling bed nestles the restless but unconscious body of a tall and stocky satyr. His long brown hair is soaked through and his hooves kick out from under the sheets in distress. An elegant figure with golden hair and completely solid silver eyes is tending to the satyr, gently patting his forehead with a damp cloth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The satyr is Gregorios, the vineyard owner and maker of wine for the gods and fellow Stewards. The person tending to him is Paeon, the local healer for the Stewards. Both Chiron and Paeon are able to convey the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two days ago Kepheus the tomb-keeper fell ill, before dying within the night. The next day another fell ill, dying that evening. Here on the third day, Gregorios is now ill with the same symptoms. If the pattern holds, he will die tonight.</li>\n<li>The people seem unrelated in their jobs and residences.</li>\n<li>Gregorios is feverous and seems to be in a restless sleep they can’t wake up from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One may have been poor circumstances, two a coincidence, but with this third illness Chiron asks the party to investigate the previous villagers, Kepheus and Melita, to see if there is a connection. They are at their residences awaiting afterlife preparations.</p>\n<h1>Clues from the Dead</h1>\n<p>The party can go to either the home of Kepheus the Tomb- Keeper or Melita the Blacksmith’s apprentice first. Kepheus is an elderly human gentleman, with long fraying hair and beard to match their years. His skin is a light olive, relatively untouched by the sun. Somebody has already changed his clothes from sleepwear to a set of robes for his journey into the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Melita bears the stature of a great warrior. Even for a human she is towering. The darkness of her skin helps highlight sunbleached hair, which has been braided tightly back, and she has been adorned in ceremonial armor.</p>\n<p>Wherever the characters arrive, they may look around with an <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>. The residences don’t turn up anything of note; the main interests are on the body:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DC 5 - There are strange bruises on their body in the shape of hooves.</li>\n<li>DC 10 - There is an animal bite mark on their body, of a large mouth.</li>\n<li>DC 15 - There are very light burns around their mouth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once a clue is found, the DC for finding the same clue on the other body drops by 3.</p>\n<p>The party are able to make the connection to the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"Eq4KpdwPuKkStDLg\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Mares of Diomedes</a> if they make a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (History) check</strong>, otherwise they will need to consult with Chiron or Paeon to learn the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The clues point to the Mares of Diomedes, previously tamed man-eating horses. If their spirits escaped from the Underworld they could have become feral again.</li>\n<li>Taming them required the flesh of Diomedes , but he is long since dead.</li>\n<li>There is a flower called ‘King’s Blood’ which only grows around Diomedes’ remains, sometimes used to quell fevers. If there is a connection to Diomedes and the mares, it may be particularly useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diomedes’ remains are in the Tomb of Kings, which is defended by traps to prevent looting. Kepheus was the only one who knew how to bypass them, though Paeon knows of a phrase he used as a reminder: “<em>Count on the Gods as your eyes, and pay the ferryman a prize</em>.”</p>\n<p>If the party gathers no clues, or does not wish to retrieve the King’s Blood, Paeon suggests the party enter Gregorios’ dream to see if they can fix the torment within - <em>Skip to Nightmares.</em></p>\n<h1>King's Blood</h1>\n<p>Stairs lead down to a circular, 30 foot diameter preparation chamber. Three tunnels split off to the east, north, and west. Down each is a series of tomb doors bearing the name of a once-king or queen.</p>\n<h2>The Preparation Chamber</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A spiral of checkered marble decorates the floor of this circular chamber. Black pillars reach to a domed navy ceiling, peppered with holes for light to streak through and form beams in the dusty air. In the center, a marble slab stands ready for the preparation of bodies, while instruments are neatly laid along mantles set between the pillars. Opposite the stairs a corridor leads into darkness, as does another on the left and the right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The holes in the ceiling form constellations. The brightest lights streak down to point out trapped tiles, although they can only do this while there is no other light source in the room. These tile pressure plates can be discovered with a <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> of the room, or a <strong>DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> of the floor.</p>\n<p>Walking through carelessly or failing the search sets off the trap. Once triggered, fire erupts from the stars, reaching everywhere in the chamber except the central altar. Each character in the area must make a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity saving throw</strong>, taking <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"Fire Damage\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"Fire Damage\" data-formula=\"6d6\"><i class=\"fas fa-dice-d20\"></i> 6d6</a> Fire Damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.</p>\n<h2>The Doorway</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each door is simple; an engraved name marks the ruler inside with a knocker of hammered brass hanging below. The ring is held up by a simple rounded fixture with a circular recess, no bigger than two inches, bearing a different monarch’s profiled face for each door.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As each door along the corridors is marked with a name, the players need only search for Diomedes, whose remains lie down the left tunnel, four doors along.</p>\n<p>Though unlocked, the doors are trapped. The trap itself isn’t visible, however, a successful <strong>DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> of the door, or a <strong>DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> of the knocker reveals a mechanism. A coin or similar object must be placed within the recess of the knocker to disarm the trap.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heaving forward the stone door, the Tomb of Diomedes is revealed, though it is small and narrow for a king. The walls bear remains of a mural, depicting chariots racing around a lake. Against the back wall a lofty ceiling accommodates an overbearing statue of a muscle-clad figure adorned with impressive plate mail. Behind the billowing beard is the faint glimpse of a sinister smile. In the tomb’s center is a sarcophagus with four sculpted mare heads for pillars supporting a lid carved with a resting figure resembling the statue. Around the base are flowers which have forced their way through the stone and happily blossom a bright red despite the lack of light, their petals dripping with thick crimson liquid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the players did not disarm the trap, the door seals itself a minute after being opened and water pours in through three holes in the peaked ceiling, filling the chamber in 5 minutes. The chamber won’t start to empty until another 5 minutes pass. On this side of the door there is an identical knocker, which can be used to disable the trap in the same way, causing the water to stop pouring in and begin to drain. The door opens after all the water is gone.</p>\n<p>There are four flowers. The sarcophagus is filled only with ash.</p>\n<h1>Nightmares</h1>\n<p>Once the party have returned with the flower, Paeon begins the preparations to turn the petals and other ingredients into a thick red tea, and allowing it to cool before pouring it down Gregorios’s throat.</p>\n<p>The fever soon fades, though <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"ycFT0iGU6bVWJMds\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Gregorios</a> is still stuck in sleep, just as distressed. With this there is only one course of action left to suggest; the party must enter Gregorios’ dream to battle the creatures themselves.</p>\n<p>The ritual to send the party into Gregorios’ dream takes an hour to prepare. Once ready, the party is sat in a circle around the bed, which has now been moved to the middle of the room. Chalk markings are sprawled across the ground and ceiling, interspersed with components and offerings such as heron feathers and a weave of fine silk. The party must drink a sleep inducing brew before Paeon’s incantations begin, lulling them into unconsciousness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your eyes open to a familiar view under a darkened sky, stars masked by fumes. Low walls of lattice and grape vines flank either side of you. A scent of ash seeps into your lungs as a roar of fire arcs across the vineyard not 100 feet away, a scream of a man echoes in the distance.</p>\n<p>Stomping across the vineyard, a giant of ashen skin, rippling muscles, and a beard of fire lets out a menacing laughter so deep it reverberates in your bones. Clad in black and bronze plate mail, wielding chains within each hand, he raises a fist and slices down to send a chain rippling across the ground, barely missing the monstrous horses circling him, their pounding hooves kicking up a thick dust. The horses themselves have coats of black, with manes and tails wreathed in flame. One of them spews black fire at the giant in retaliation. Amidst the chaos a tall and stout satyr scrambles to avoid the chaos. Suddenly the horses change pace and charge towards you at incredible speed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"Eq4KpdwPuKkStDLg\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Nightmares</a> equal to the number of party members. Before combat, the party can choose to make a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failure, a charging mare’s spirit merges with theirs for the battle, granting them fire resistance and a breath weapon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an action on their turn, the creature can let out a 15 foot cone of dark red flame. Any targets within the area must succeed on a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or take <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"Necrotic Damage\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"Necrotic Damage\" data-formula=\"4d6\"><i class=\"fas fa-dice-d20\"></i> 4d6</a> Necrotic Damage, or half as much on a success.</li>\n<li>Once used, the creature must roll a 5 or 6 on a <a class=\"inline-roll gmroll\" title=\"Flame Cone Recharge\" data-mode=\"gmroll\" data-flavor=\"Flame Cone Recharge\" data-formula=\"1d6\"><i class=\"fas fa-dice-d20\"></i> 1d6</a> at the start of their turn in order to use it again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>During Combat</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Any unmerged horses will continue to try merging with the available party members, seeing them as their best chance at defeating Diomedes.</li>\n<li>Diomedes will fight to the death, frequently bellowing phrases of arrogance and anger.</li>\n<li>Gregorios is focussed on staying alive, but can be persuaded to fight. He uses the veteran stat block.</li>\n<li>If Gregorios was given the King’s Blood concoction, he has resistance against any damage from Diomedes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once Diomedes is defeated, the dream collapses, abruptly waking the party in Gregorios’ home, with the wine-maker following suit. The mares are no longer present.</p>\n<p>Should the party fail in defeating Diomedes or saving Gregorios, they will be returned in a similar fashion, though Gregorios will be dead. After the party’s next rest one member won’t wake up. Diomedes has invaded their dreams and must be defeated there.</p>\n<p>For their efforts, Paeon offers the party two <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.items\" data-id=\"L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Potions of Greater Healing</a>, and Chiron pays them 500 gold pieces.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L08.png"}

The messenger never returns and the players are sent to investigate their disappearance. During their investigation, the players uncover a malicious plot of the hag <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"qqJ0wdoau4y8AHWb\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Theatralis</a> and will need to end her influence over the Amazons.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Kalogeros, in an effort to deal with the rising problems that occurred recently, sent a messenger to Fort Themis, the renowned stronghold of the Amazon fighter’s guild, to request help in these troubling times. Steward Chiron sent the messenger a few days ago and the messenger has not returned yet. While negotiations for help from the Amazons in the past have proven to be difficult due to their pride and stubbornness, it has never taken this long for the messenger to return. He suspects something must have happened.</p>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"zf4tLE5NHQLrz4ut\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Chiron</a> approaches the players to tell them about the missing messenger and explains his concerns. He asks the players to look into this situation, since assuring the help of the Amazons would go far in keeping the village safe, especially when the players leave Mount Olympus and travel into Hades to confront Cerberus directly.</p>\n<p>Chiron can communicate any or all of the following to the players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fort Themis lies on Mount Olympus, halfway between Kalogeros and the home of the gods, and has been the traditional home and training grounds of the Amazons for millenia.</li>\n<li>The Amazons are each mighty warriors in their own right and possess traces of divine blood in their veins. Many great heroines had their beginnings in Themis.</li>\n<li>The current Taskmaster of Themis is Hippolyta, demigod daughter of Ares. She is an accomplished warrior and dedicated herself to the tutelage of the Themis Amazons. She is a woman of great pride, and will scorn you if you do not pay her the respect she demands.</li>\n<li>The path up to the Fort is usually secure thanks to the Amazons, but in the face of recent events, the head steward is no longer sure if this is the case. Perhaps the messenger never made it to Themis in the first place.</li>\n<li>Above all else the Amazons, true warriors as they are, respect strength and competence. If one wants to earn their respect, a display of fighting prowess is the best way to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The steward suggests to begin the search for the messenger along the path to Fort Themis, in case something has happened to the messenger on their journey. If they find no traces of the messenger along the way, the party is to ask Hippolyta about the messenger herself, for perhaps the messenger made it to Fort Themis after all.</p>\n<h1>What Happened At Fort Themis?</h1>\n<p>A wicked green hag named <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"qqJ0wdoau4y8AHWb\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Theatralis</a> escaped the underworld and has set herself up among the Amazons in Fort Themis using her innate magic to walk among them unnoticed. Theatralis’s goal is to spread mistrust among the Amazons against the outside world, causing them to isolate. She hopes to slowly and surely manipulate them and take control of <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"YQz3EJGggnKHZaey\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Hippolyta</a> for good, securing the warriors as powerful personal enforcers.</p>\n<p>Theatralis is not alone in her endeavor. Besides the ettercaps, she escaped together with two other members of her coven. But because circumstances in the underworld only allowed one of them to escape, the other two green hags, named Tragodia and Dranis, stored their souls into theater masks which Theatralis was able to bring with her. Theatralis has no plans to reverse their state as they agreed, but instead plans on finding a way to syphon their powers behind their backs. For now, the three hags maintain an uneasy alliance.</p>\n<p>In order to gain control over Hippolyta, Theatralis laid a powerful hex upon the Amazon Taskmaster’s prized belt. The hex feeds on Hippolyta's negative emotions, which Theatralis exaggerates by making her distrustful and paranoid. Though the hex is not yet at the apex of its power, Hippolyta is charmed by Theatralis, which makes the Taskmaster an easy target for the suggestions of the hag.</p>\n<p>To further ease the manipulation of the Amazons, Theatralis laced the brine of the Amazon’s conserved foods with droplets of water from the River Styx that she collected before she exited the underworld. Though it is diluted enough to not make the Amazons completely lose their memories, it is enough to make their memories hazey and unreliable. A long term ingestion of the diluted water would make the entirety of the Amazons easy targets for gaslighting at the hand of the hag.</p>\n<p>Some time after placing the curse on the Taskmaster’s Girdle, the Taskmaster’s Confidant became suspicious of the change of Hippolyta’s behavior and began challenging the Taskmaster’s decisions. Not wanting the Confidant to uncover the secret of the cursed belt and draw unwanted attention, Theatralis killed her in her sleep and has taken over her identity ever since. Though unplanned, this fruitful opportunity put Theatralis even closer to Hippolyta.</p>\n<p>Theatralis sought to plant the seed of distrust in the Amazon Taskmaster when the messenger arrived. Using the power of the belt, she had Hippolyta insist that the messenger stay for the night to await her answer on the next morning. In the night, Theatralis used a potion to turn the messenger into a goat and placed them in the pen with the rest of the fort’s livestock. She then took on their guise the next morning. Theatralis, in the disguise of the messenger, openly disrespected Hippolyta in front of the other Amazons. As soon as the disguised Theatralis left the fort, she used her invisibility to sneak back into the fort to behold the results of her performance.</p>\n<p>Theatralis was expecting another messenger to arrive, but did not expect the player characters to arrive. Knowing of the but will strike if the players get too close to the truth of her machinations.</p>\n<h1>Arrival at Fort Themis</h1>\n<p>Fort Themis lies on the mountainside of Mount Olympus, 12 miles away from the town. A mountain path connects Kalogeros to Fort Themis with a few wayshrines dedicated to Hermes along the way to ensure a safe journey.</p>\n<p>The journey does not have to be safe though. The players are very likely to engage in a roleplay heavy segment once they enter Fort Themis. If your players prefer a combat heavy experience, consider adding a random encounter along the way!</p>\n<p>After several hours of travel, the players reach Fort Themis, a secure and imposing structure. Read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A thin, winding path crawls up the mountainside to a large fortress which proudly rises from the Olympian mountainside. Its unbowing gate and towering walls allow no entry. Atop its mighty ramparts are two sentries, both tall and battle-hardened women. They are eying you, watching your every move, longbows at the ready.</p>\n<p>\"State your business\" one of the Amazons demands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The players will likely attempt to enter through the front gate, where two Amazon guards on the ramparts will stop them. They will have their longbows at the ready — they are not expecting guests. The players get a chance to explain themselves and ask about the messenger. The Amazons will answer that the messenger came and went. They are unfriendly and the Amazon’s dislike for the players becomes apparent, especially if the players state that they arrived on behalf of Kalogeros.</p>\n<p>If the players insist on talking to the Taskmaster Hippolyta, one of the two Amazons will leave to ask Hippolyta what should be done with the players. She will return to grant the players entrance to Fort Themis.</p>\n<h2>Meeting Taskmaster Hippolyta</h2>\n<p>Taskmaster Hippolyta will meet the players on the training grounds of the Fort: a sprawling yard with different training equipment and always busy during the day. Hippolyta will answer the player’s questions, though she will not go into too much detail of the events, as she herself is still livid over the \"messenger's\" grave insult. For the entirety of the meeting, Theatralis will be present and disguised as the Taskmaster’s Confidant.</p>\n<p>What Taskmaster Hippolyta knows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The messenger arrived in the afternoon and presented a plea from Kalogeros that Hippolyta was to send some of her capable warriors to protect the town.</li>\n<li>Hippolyta demanded time to contemplate the request, to which the messenger agreed to, granted they were to stay for the night. If successfully pressed on the matter with a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Persuasion) check</strong>, Hippolyta will admit that though willing to send help, her pride prevented her from offering her assistance too eagerly.</li>\n<li>The next morning, when Hippolyta summoned the messenger and let them know that the Amazons were ready to help, the messenger reacted incredibly ungrateful towards her offer, claiming that it was not enough and that the town was entitled to further protection by the Amazons. Insulted, Hippolyta sent the messenger away and shut the gates behind them. That was the last she saw of the messenger.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allow the players to make an Insight check against the Taskmaster. Though she tells the truth, the players can learn about her mental state. A <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> will reveal that Taskmaster Hippolyta’s behavior appears to be off, as if her negative emotions are being tempered with. A roll of <strong>20 or higher</strong> on the check will reveal to a player that Taskmaster Hippolyta shows signs of being charmed.</p>\n<p>Theatralis is observing the talk between the players and the Taskmaster carefully. The moment one of the players presses on the matter of unrest she, in the guise of the Confidant, will dismiss these claims and press Hippolyta to end the meeting, to which Hippolyta will agree.</p>\n<p>After the meeting with the Taskmaster, the players are allowed to stay in the Fort, though the Amazons will treat the players with mistrust and barely tolerate their presence. If the players act suspiciously in their investigation without an effort to improve their standing with the Amazons, they are sent away immediately. Theatralis herself is confident that the players will not find anything in their investigation and return back to town.</p>\n<h1>The Investigation</h1>\n<p>From this point on, the players are free to investigate the whereabouts of the messenger.</p>\n<h2>Fort Themis Points of Interest</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taskmaster Quarters (secured)</strong>. Here the players can learn more about the cursed girdle.</li>\n<li><strong>Training Grounds. </strong>Here the players can better their status among the Amazons.</li>\n<li><strong>Pens.</strong> The cursed messenger remains in the Pens</li>\n<li><strong>Food Storage. </strong>The food is laced with traces of water from the River Styx</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Quarters. </strong>Living area for the Amazons, the Confidant’s room is found here.</li>\n<li><strong>Armory &amp; Treasury. </strong>Weapons and money are being stored here.</li>\n<li><strong>Olympian Shrine</strong>. Shrines that represent all the Olympian gods for worship are set up here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before the players are able to freely move about Fort Themis they will have to better their standing with the Amazons. Earning their trust will reward them with their help, as well as useful information for their investigation.</p>\n<p>If the players decide to prematurely leave the Fort, have one of the Amazons approach them in secret. This Amazon has grown concerned over strange events that transpired in Fort Themis and will tell the players of one of the four strange events she has been observing.</p>\n<h2>Establishing Trust</h2>\n<p>Players can attempt to establish trust between themselves and select Amazons with a successful <strong>DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. Alternatively players can also attempt to engage with them in a sparring match in the ring (combat), or challenge them to a competitive athletic game, for which the player character and the Amazon would make a competing Athletics check. If the player wins, they earn the Amazon’s respect.</p>\n<p>Once respect with one of the Amazons has been established, the players can ask her questions. She will admit that she has been observing strange occurrences in the Fort as of late. Roll 1d4 on the following table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>1d4</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The Amazon is one of the few to actually recognize that the Taskmaster has been charmed, but her lack of knowledge of the arcane makes it impossible to deduce that magic is involved.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The Amazon noticed that suddenly there was a new goat in the pen and it seems to be in a constant state of distress.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The Amazon laments that the food has been changed to be exclusively pickled, even though they have fresh food available. Furthermore, the food the Amazon had recently has been tasting odd and made her mouth feel strangely numb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>The Amazon knew the Taskmaster’s Confidant well enough to notice her change in behavior. The Taskmaster and the Confidant were often arguing until just a few days ago, when it suddenly stopped overnight.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the players successfully investigate the event the Amazon observed and report back to her with their findings, she will decide to join the players in finding out the truth and will offer her assistance by the players' side when they confront the Hag.</p>\n<h2>Fighting in the Training Grounds</h2>\n<p>The Amazon training ground will be a likely place for the players to have sparring matches with the Amazons. Spread among the training ground are several combat dummies, targets and other training equipment. While fighting on the training ground, the players can interact in unique ways with the training equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Training Dummy</strong>: In combat a character can attack a training dummy, causing it to swing around widely. Once struck with an attack, a random medium creature within five feet of the dummy that is not the attacker must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is hit by the swinging dummy, granting attacks against it advantage until the end of the turn. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is hit with such force, that it is knocked prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Archery Target</strong>: An archery target is large enough to grant a creature 3/4th cover against ranged attacks, if a creature is behind it.</p>\n<p><strong>The Charmed Taskmaster</strong>: The players can attempt to cast detect magic on her, though Hippolyta will not knowingly consent to such an \"invasion of privacy\". An aura of enchantment magic surrounds her girdle.</p>\n<p>The girdle is a prized possession of Hippolyta, given to her by her father Ares. The girdle's magic affects her even if she is not wearing it because of her sentimental connection to it. The players can attempt to use stealth and distraction to get the girdle. She wears it during the day along with her armor, but not at night, when she retreats to her room for sleep.</p>\n<p>The spell remove curse or dispel magic would both be enough to break the curse and free her from the hag’s influence. Hippolyta will become aware that she was charmed, but not by whom. Once she learns though that it was the players who broke the charm, she will cooperate with the players to uncover the events at Fort Themis, as well as fighting by their side when the players confront the hag.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sudden Goat</strong>: A pen with goats and other small livestock is tended to by one of the Amazons during the day. Unless she trusts the players or is otherwise distracted, the Amazon will not allow the players to get too close to the pens or interact with any of the goats.</p>\n<p>A player who visits the pens will notice one of the goats desperately trying to get their attention. A <strong>DC 15 (Wisdom) Animal Handling or Insight check</strong> will reveal that this goat is showing signs of consciousness, and seems to understand what is spoken to it.</p>\n<p>The players can also cast speak with animals to communicate with the messenger-turned-goat directly, who will let the players know of the hag’s presence and her scheme to sow discord among the Amazons towards the town.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the players can make use of dispel magic to break the transformation of the goat and return the messenger back to their human form.</p>\n<p><strong>The Strange Food</strong>: The players can investigate the food storage of the Fort. The door to the pantry is locked, which can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or be broken open with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. If the players break in during the day, they will alert nearby Amazons. The key to the door can be found in the Confidant’s Room. Once per day the Confidant opens the pantry for the Amazons to retrieve the supplies they need for the day. The Confidant keeps a close eye on who enters and leaves the pantry during that time.</p>\n<p>The pantry contains foods such as jerky, flour and a large amount of pickled vegetables. Investigating the pickled vegetables reveals that they carry a foul odor. Upon tasting them one’s tongue becomes numb for one minute. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will reveal that the food has been laced with drops of water from the River Styx; and the information of its mind affecting properties is revealed.</p>\n<h2>Confidant</h2>\n<p>The players can attempt to shadow the 'Confidant' to catch her in the act of suspicious behavior. The players have to beat Theatralis’ passive perception with stealth checks. If they fail or follow her without using stealth, she will grow suspicious. When this happens Theatralis will try to stay in character and tell the players to not bother her, as she is too busy to tend to them. If this happens, Theatralis will require one less successful event before taking initiative (see \"Theatralis Reacts\").</p>\n<h2>Theatralis Reacts</h2>\n<p>If Theatralis notices the players getting too close to the truth, she will take things into her own hands.</p>\n<p>Once the players have successfully investigated 3 events, the news of their successful investigation will reach Theatralis, unless the players went out of their way to keep their findings secret. She will take the guise of the Taskmaster’s Confidant once more and alert them of supposed treachery of the players, unless her spell over her has been broken, which will cause Hippolyta to confront the players alongside several of her guards on the Fort’s training ground.</p>\n<p>If the Taskmaster has been freed from her spell, Theatralis will take on her guise instead and accuse her of being an imposter placed by the village and the players. The Amazons at this point are in a semi-suggestible state due to their poisoned rations, and are susceptible to these lines of argument.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if Theatralis finds an opportunity to dispose of one of the players on her own, she will attempt to do so; perhaps using her disguise as an Amazon to lure away one of the players to then attack them in her true form.</p>\n<p>If the players stay for the night in the fort, she will attempt to feed a player one of her polymorph potions to turn them into livestock as she did the messenger.</p>\n<h1>Confronting Theatralis</h1>\n<p>If the players are able to break the curse from Hippolyta, she will join the player's effort in breaking the hag’s hold over the Fort. Theatralis, unwilling to give up the effort she has put into manipulating the Fort, will take on the guise of Hippolyta and claim the original to be a fake.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter</strong>: If Hippolyta remains influenced by Theatralis, four <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"qaO0qa7wcL6yYCpG\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Amazon Warriors</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"qqJ0wdoau4y8AHWb\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Theatralis</a> herself (use green hag statistics, with full coven abilities) aid her in combat against the players. Theatralis will attempt to stay out of the fight with her invisibility, but will step in to fight the players the moment Hippolyta is defeated. Further, each round if there are less than 4 Amazon Warriors left in combat, 1 more joins combat as reinforcements, as long as Theatralis is alive or has not retreated.</p>\n<p>Depending on the decisions of the player characters, Hippolyta and other Amazon Warriors might fight on the side of the players. If Hippolyta fights by the side of the players, 2 more Amazon Warriors will side with Theatralis in her magic disguise.</p>\n<h1>Resolution</h1>\n<p>If the players are able to dismantle Theatralis’ hold over the Fort, the Amazons will cooperate and help Kalogeros with their defense against the rising problems and monsters. Further, Hippolyta who acknowledges the player’s part in saving Themis from the hag’s influence bestows upon them her treasured girdle. While she has great fondness for the Girdle, she sees the hag’s deeds as her fault, as she failed to notice her presence. To atone for her failure and to humble herself, she parts with her Girdle.</p>\n<p>If Hippolyta died, the Fort will be in a state of disarray without leadership. They will be occupied with finding a new Taskmaster for several weeks and will not be able to send a few Amazon Warriors to help Kalogeros.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L09.png"}
{"_id":"oUqiQX7OIqKMg4a9","name":"L02. The Hydra of Lake Naiads","permission":{"default":0,"qAL5EfqtgJHvFnLg":3},"folder":"NHJAyEyaqqEf9Fhb","sort":325000,"flags":{},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>By C.A. Berlitz and Alex</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Disturbing accounts of a beast lurking beneath the waves have been reported by steward fishers on Lake Naiads — named for the nymphish spirits that protect the waters. In this labor, Chiron summons the adventurers to investigate the origin of these accounts and put an end to what he fears is another symptom of Cerberus. Chiron is correct: the adventurers will learn that a hydra has entered the lake through a portal to the Underworld that remains open; swallowing water spirits and draining the vitality from the lake. Adventurers must defeat the hydra and close the portal to bring peace to Lake Naiads.</p>\n<h1>Reptilian Reports</h1>\n<p>Lake Naiads sits in a lush valley on Mount Olympus, some few miles from the village of Kalogeros. A small fishing infrastructure lines its southern shores, where stewards gather to fish from the lake with the blessing of Akheloios, god of fresh waters. Recently, balance has been disturbed. The naiad spirits that protect the lake have begun to disappear. Fishers say that a reptilian creature has attacked their boats — some folk have gone missing and are presumed dead. Chiron offers a generous 1000 gp reward if the adventurers can learn more about these reports and address their origin. He advises them to travel to Lake Naiads, gather reports from the fishers to learn what they can, and then determine their course of action.</p>\n<h2>Gathering Intel</h2>\n<p>Fishing activity on the lake has come to a near standstill due to the disturbance, but there are still a number of fishers occupying the docks and fishing huts on the shore. The characters can gather information on the creature by speaking with the various fishers on Lake Naiads or by investigating the shoreline itself. For each half-hour the adventurers spend gathering information, have them roll a <strong>DC 10 ability check</strong>. The type of check is determined by whatever method the characters are using to acquire information. They may be speaking to villagers, inspecting debris from wrecked boats on the shore, or gathering physical clues. On a successful check, the players learn one piece of information from the list below. On a check that succeeds by 5 or more, the players learn three pieces of information. Using ability checks such as History, Investigation, or Arcana, characters may be able to infer some pieces of information after learning others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creature has razor-sharp claws, capable of tearing boats to shreds.</li>\n<li>The creature has long reach, and is able to swipe at boats from below the waves with its tail.</li>\n<li>The creature has at least two heads, probably more.</li>\n<li>The creature is vulnerable to fire.</li>\n<li>The nymph spirits around the lake have been disappearing; they may be willing to help if asked.</li>\n<li>Offerings to the nymphs are expected from those who seek their help. They have a small altar dedicated to them along the east shoreline.</li>\n<li>The north shore of the lake, opposite the fishing infrastructure, has been glowing with a strange purple light.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chiron has unknowingly requested the aid of the characters just in time. The power of the portal in the lake continues to degrade the ecosystem and destroy the naiads. Soon, the health of the lake will be permanently degraded. For each hour that passes, characters may notice the lake's waters becoming visibly darker as it is drained of its vitality. The longer the characters spend gathering information, the more damage they risk to Lake Naiads. If the characters do not confront the hydra within eight hours, the naiads will not be able to provide much help, should the characters seek their aid (see \"Consulting the Naiads\").</p>\n<h2>Consulting The Naiads</h2>\n<p>If the characters learn of the naiads and seek their aid, they can find the altar dedicated to them along the east shoreline, a short walk from the fishing docks. When the characters arrive at the altar, read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gentle waves lap at the base of a small altar of grey stone that is surrounded by a loosely-arranged semicircle of rocks. Atop the altar, bleached goat skulls and thick locks of hair are arranged in neat rows. The air smells fresh and flowery. A gentle, mournful singing can just barely be heard on the breeze.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A character who offers a lock of their hair or sacrifices an animal on the altar while succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Religion) check summons a naiad spirit. The naiad introduces herself as Thespa, and can explain the following to the characters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A hydra crawled through a portal to the Underworld that opened into the lake.</li>\n<li>The portal can be found near the north shoreline, just under the waves.</li>\n<li>The portal is quickly draining naiads of their energy and is swallowing them into the Underworld. • Underworld influence also threatens the health of the lake itself.</li>\n<li>The portal may be closed by driving back the creature which tore it open. Hopefully, this creature was the hydra.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thespa is distraught and deeply scared of the hydra and the portal, worrying that it may be too late to help. A successful <strong>DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong> convinces Thespa to gather whichever naiads are willing to help the adventurers in their confrontation against the hydra and their task to close the portal.</p>\n<h1>The Hydra</h1>\n<p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"zcxnb728PGr8vU6U\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Hydra</a> lairs beside the portal near the north shore of Lake Naiads to ensure its protection. Whether the players approach by land or by water, when they near the portal, read the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A maw of sparkling purple light shimmers just beneath the waves, only a few dozen feet from the shoreline. Colorless vapor wafts upwards from the water, lending a phosphoric smell to the air. The sand on the floor of the lake shifts rhythmically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hydra lurks beside the portal, burrowed underneath the sand of the lake floor. It attempts to catch the adventurers unawares. If the adventurers have received help from the naiad spirits, they arrive after a single round of combat and immediately begin to buffet the creature with swarming spectral energy, forcing it to make all attacks against the adventurers with disadvantage. It fights until it is destroyed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Giant Mudcrab.</strong></em> A <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"ljnpRTMOKWdZFPXb\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Giant Mudcrab</a> rests in a burrow adjacent to the portal that predates the hydra. The mudcrab and the hydra have little interest in each other, and have peacefully coexisted since the hydra arrived. The arrival of the adventurers and the ruckus that ensues in their battle against the hydra angers the mudcrab, which crawls out of its burrow to attack the characters, joining the fight at Initiative Count 10.</p>\n<h2>The Portal</h2>\n<p>Just a dozen feet below the surface of the lake, the portal connects the Acheron River of the Underworld with Lake Naiads of Mount Olympus, and can be closed one of three ways: A maw of sparkling purple light shimmers just beneath the waves, only a few dozen feet from the shoreline. Colorless vapor wafts upwards from the water, lending a phosphoric smell to the air. The sand on the floor of the lake shifts rhythmically.</p>\n<p><strong>Send back that which opened it.</strong> A portal to the Underworld can be closed by forcefully sending back the person(s) or creature(s) which opened it. In this case, throwing even a single severed head of the hydra through the portal is sufficient for fulfilling this clause.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel magic. </strong>The portal can be closed with a successful casting of dispel magic. The initial DC for success is 15. The portal is reactive and unstable however, and each unsuccessful attempt at casting dispel magic further raises the DC by 3. Eventually, the portal may pulse with energy and become too adaptive to the spell, making a successful dispel practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Destroy it.</strong> Directing enough magical energy at the portal will destroy it. The portal has an AC of 15 and 50 hitpoints. It can only be targeted and damaged by \"physical\" spells — nonmagical weapons and spells that require Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throws from their target have no effect.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing magical energy at the portal is risky.</strong></em> The portal is reactive and dangerous; any creature that targets the portal with a spell must immediately make a<strong> DC 13 Dexterity saving throw</strong>, otherwise the portal mirrors the damage towards the caster, who takes half the rolled damage of their spell on a failed save, and half that amount on a successful one.</p>\n<h1>Resolution</h1>\n<p>Word of the adventurers' success will quickly travel throughout the fishing docks and back towards the village of Kalogeros and to Chiron, if they do not first inform him themselves. Chiron thanks them profusely for their efforts and gifts them a Decanter of Endless Water.</p>\n<p>If the players sought the aid of the naiads, the spirits are subtle in their thanks — each character is granted a point of Inspiration. Characters may also collect a portion of the hydra blood to craft an <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.items\" data-id=\"gyK6FwAlhneMtglh\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Elixir of the Damned</a>.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L02a.png"}

Aclippe has dragged several wounded villagers to safety behind a low wall and is now tending to their wounds. A few houses beyond, excited villagers are screaming while pointing at the steward's villa; several more villagers are running back toward the villa carrying spears and bows.</p>\n<h1>Unwelcome Guests</h1>\n<p>If the characters inquire, they are told that a group of intruders were caught trying to sneak into the house. Fortunately, Chiron was absent at the time, having been meeting with the characters upon their arrival to Kalogeros. The fight that followed left several villagers wounded but they were able to drive the intruders away. One of the intruders was forced to hide, climbing up to a hayloft behind the house. Descriptions of the attackers vary, but it can be learned that they were led by a bulky man and fought with primal fury, using clawed hands as much as weapons. Investigating the scene allows the characters to notice a set of tracks, including some large paw-prints, about two hands in width, heading out of the village. A successful <strong>DC 12 (Wisdom) Survival check</strong> allows a character to identify them as the prints of a large lion. Examination of the hayloft behind the villa shows claw marks suggesting that something scaled the wall. If the party decides to wait for Chiron, he arrives shortly behind them and offers them their first reward if they can secure the building and deal with whatever attacked his villa.</p>\n<p>When the characters enter the hayloft, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hayloft is uncomfortably warm. Blades of sunlight pour in through the slits between the planks, bathing the area in dim light. Leaves of various types hang from the beams to dry; their smells mingle in the confined space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bottom half of the building is empty — harvest is still several weeks away.

If the characters inquire, Gayle can provide a silvered longsword and half a dozen silvered arrowheads to the party.</p>\n<h3>Lycaon's Story</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lycaon joined the village as the latest of Chiron's many wards. One day, Chiron received a mysterious item from distant Nemea: an offering for him to bring to the gods. The following night, Lycaon, intrigued by his master's secrecy, sneaked into the back room to investigate. He quickly discovered the item, the tanned hide of a large lion. Unfortunately, as he fastened the pelt, he learned too late the perils of his curiosity. The pelt, intended to show the gods' foolishness. Now cursed with lycanthropy, the village felt no choice but to exile him to the mundane world. There, Lycaon reluctantly threw his lot with a group of bandits. Lycaon blames Chiron equally for his part in the curse because he feels that the centaur turned his back on him when the village decided to exile him. Over time, his anger and bitterness grew, and he started to suspect that the cursed amphora was only a cruel test set by Kyron, maybe even a trap. Lycaon rationalized away his moral objections. After all, if the fates had doomed him to such grim existence, why should he extend more pity to his fellow mortals? Soon, he had become the bandits' leader and for months, they terrorized the countryside until a band of heroes successfully killed him and his party, sending him to the Underworld.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Tracking Lycaon</h2>\n<p>If presented with this information or the words of body of Segner, Chiron's face darkens as he realizes what is happening. Reluctantly and clearly ashamed, he shares what he knows with the players (see the \"Lycaon's story\" sidebar). If prompted, Kyron can also provide directions to the villa that Lycaon once inhabited.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the trail can be followed. In this case, the party soon encounter the remains of two deer laying in a small clearing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you advance, the forest becomes surprisingly quiet. The trees part in front of you, revealing a small clearing beyond. As you peer between the trunk, you notice the forms of two deer, laying in a pool of congealed blood, ripped open by powerful claws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The animals were brought down by a quartet of Lycaon's followers (use ghoul statistics). The character leading the party must succeed on a <strong>DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong>. On a failure, the party was travelling down-wind and the ghouls sense the party coming, hiding in the nearby bushes to ambush the party as they are distracted by the fallen deer. On a success, neither side is surprised, and initiative can be rolled as normal. If the character leading the party succeed on their Wisdom (Survival) checks by 5 or more, they find the four ghouls crouched around their prey, feasting before taking the remnants back to their companions. In this case, the ghouls are surprised.</p>\n<p>If the characters managed to surprise the ghouls, read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Four decaying humanoid creatures are crouched around the animals, shoving each other and tearing away large chunks of bloody meat to shove in their toothy maws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>The Abandoned Villa</h1>\n<p>The characters eventually emerge from the woods to see the villa.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the ground starts to rise. The top of the hill has been cleared and is now occupied with the remnants of a once opulent villa. Nature has long since reclaimed the place. Doors and shutters lie on the ground, once beautiful wall mosaics have now crumbled away and trees pierce through the broken rooftop. On the western side of the building, the outer wall has partly collapsed, revealing the corridor beyond. Standing in front of the door is another one of the slender, pallid humanoids you have seen before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The crumbled wall section provides an alternative point of entry to the characters. Lycaon has posted one of his followers to guard the main door. If this guard spots the characters, he immediately rushes to the atrium to warn his master.</p>\n<p>The inside of the villa is in an equally decrepit state and any items of interest have long been either pilfered or rotted away. A tall tree that once grew in the atrium has collapsed and is now leaning at an odd angle, propped-up by what is left of the room.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Doorframe Trap. </strong></em>The doorframe to the atrium has been rigged to collapse on a makeshift trap. The trap is activated whenever a creature attempts to pass through the doorway. A creature standing in the doorway takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a <strong>DC 15 Strength saving throw</strong> or be restrained until it takes an action to dig itself out. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> enables a character to notice the trap. Propping the doorframe open, for example using some of the plentiful debris, effectively disarms the trap. When the characters enter the atrium, read:</p>\n<p>The center of the villa is occupied by an atrium, surrounded by a colonnade. Like the rest of the villa, the place has been abandoned, long enough for several trees to take root. One tree has collapsed into the back corner of the atrium. At the foot of the tree, a tall, broadshouldered man with lion-like features is engaging in an animated discussion with a half-dozen more ghouls.</p>\n<p>Lycaon and his seven <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"cycle-of-cerberus.npcs\" data-id=\"aGMK8jSiIkmgnSfD\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Ghoul</a> followers (eight if the guard is with them) are waiting in the villa's atrium. Lycaon is a weretiger, with the following modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lycaon's charisma score is 16.</li>\n<li>His hit points are increased to 176.</li>\n<li>He wields a greataxe rather than a scimitar, though his damage remains the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless warned of the characters' imminent arrival, Lycaon and the ghouls are arguing about what to do next. The ghouls wish to leave the village while Lycaon is not ready to abandon his chance at revenge and wants to wait for the cover of night to try another attack. His followers disagree with the plan, but not quite yet to the point of abandoning their leader.</p>\n<p>If warned, Lycaon orders his followers to hide in the adjacent rooms and attempt to flank the characters, focusing on any character trapped in the rubble of the doorway. Otherwise, they target any spellcasters they identify. Lycaon avoids using his bite attack as despite his bitterness towards his own affliction, he believes that his enemies are not worthy of the curse of lycanthropy. If he feels swarmed by fighters, he jumps on the collapsed tree to reduce the number of enemies that can target him at once.</p>\n<p>The werelion angrily accuses the characters of being sent by Chiron to murder him and is well past discussing. It would take a considerable effort and a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm him down and end the encounter peacefully. After all, he already died once and has nowhere left to go. His followers are more pliable and might be convinced to give up the fight if Lycaon is defeated.</p>\n<h1>Development</h1>\n<p>If the characters report on their successful fight against the lycanthrope, Chiron is most grateful.

More must be done than simply slaying the monstrous canine however, as once its lifeforce has been sundered the strays that result must be collected from their minders, tamed, and gathered together so that Cerberus might yet be born anew.

Tormented moans fill the air with a wail permeated by dread and in the far distance you can hear hordes of maddened shrieking; the screaming warcries of armies in endless battle. The finality of this awful place weighs upon you like a thousand chains and you are nearly compelled to join in the howling of the condemned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>River Styx</h1>\n<p>In order to cross the River Styx the PCs must pay a toll to Charon (the brooding, ominous, silent skeletal ferryman requires two coins each), convince him to let them pass with a <strong>DC 21 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, fool him with a&nbsp; <strong>DC 24 Charisma (Deception) check</strong>, or bribe him with something unique. Otherwise the party must forge their way across the waterway, which is no simple task. At its shortest width the River Styx is 50 feet across, and any attempt to use magical flight to fly over it automatically fails (causing the flying creature to fall into the water). The anger and wrath of destroyed souls flow through the waterway, manifesting when they sense life to reach out to grasp at the existence denied to them. Whenever a creature first touches the River Styx or when it starts its turn in the area, roll 1d20. On a 20, ethereal arms lash out and try to drag the creature into the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Grasp of the Dead.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.</em> <br>Hit: The target is grappled. At the start of its turn a grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Athletics) check (DC 16 + 1 per turn spent grappled), escaping on a success, or being dragged 5 feet deeper into the supernatural waters on a failure.</p>\n<h2>Lore: An Offering of Gold</h2>\n<p>If given one of the Apples of Hesperides from the last labor, Charon is exceptionally friendly to the party and explains the cycle of Cerberus, and his suspicion Hera has hidden something down in the Underworld not too long ago—though what that is remains uncertain.</p>\n<h1>Cerberus Unbound</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorrow fills the very air on the other side of the River Styx, heavy with the regrets of a thousand lives that never met their potential. Looming up ahead of you is a massive fence of wicked black metal posts that stretch up into the sky and out of sight, each bit of unholy iron festooned with sharp barbs, grotesque teeth, and the flesh of those who’ve tried to slip through the narrow gaps. Strewn all about the ground on either side are corpses aplenty—mostly humanoids but a few monstrous cadavers as well—mercilessly bruised, ripped apart, and clearly the result of a great deal of suffering. Leaping and dashing around them is the flowing shadowy hulk of Cerberus, the guardian of this place, erratic in its supernaturally fast movements and obviously in the grips of a savage mania.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the adventurers are across the River Styx little effort is required to find @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.pQ3so1qVem9eJ76Y]{Cerberus} —the three-headed hound is howling and jumping about the gates to the Underworld, ripping apart incoming souls as monstrous creatures dash out of confinement and rush towards the mortal realm. When the PCs have defeated the legendary monster however, its corpse does not lie still and instead three spectral pups emerge, fiercely barking before dashing away through the rockface as they gain solidity.</p>\n<p><strong>First Hound.</strong> The gorgon @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.AolAdZmVAH4bs5aa]{Danaos} (which uses the statistics of a medusa) dwells just past the gates of the Underworld inside of a cave with a half dozen statues outside, each caught in a rictus of surprise or pain. Hera has promised him an island kingdom in the seas above in exchange for waiting for a @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.KWzzM2kMS63hKSEC]{Cerberean Hound} to arrive and then keeping the pup from rejoining with the others. To make sure his gaze is effective Danaos keeps torches throughout his lair making sure the entirety is well lit.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Hound.</strong> @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.EroYLceYljeXtLfL]{Ianeira} and @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.gvz3fDtQyupUN5MX]{Mnasyllus} (a pair of manticores with Intelligence scores of 17) stand vigil over the entrance to the next cave with a trail of sooty paws leading inside. One of them announces, “just within are two doors—a door leading to the hound and another with only death beyond it.” The other manticore says, “one of us can only deceive and the other is burdened by truth. Together we will answer you one question. What do you ask?” If the PCs choose the correct path they only have to fight the @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.KWzzM2kMS63hKSEC]{Cerberean Hound}, but if they choose the wrong door they face both manticores and the lethal canine all at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Hound.</strong> The last cave is supernaturally dark as if under the constant effects of a darkness spell, further obscuring a passage hidden at the back. The secret tunnel (and a bound, poisoned Hercules) can be found with a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>. This area is home to an @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.qUL0Om5TPld8GrMh]{Underworld Shadow} (which uses the statistics of a young black dragon) however, a creature wrought in the bowels of Tartarus that despises all things from the mortal realm and attacks the party on sight alongside the @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.KWzzM2kMS63hKSEC]{Cerberean Hound}.</p>\n<p>When the last of the cerberean hounds is captured, a collective <strong>DC 30 Strength check (adding the Strength modifiers of each creature helping)</strong> squeezes the trio of supernatural pups back into the fearsome Cerberus once more. The Underworld is sealed once again and for now the troubles of Mount Olympus will stop wreaking havoc on the world at large.</p>\n<h2>Lore: A Hero in Need</h2>\n<p>Hercules came down here to best and slay Cerberus as he has so many times before, but unlike normal a poison was beaded on the thrice-headed hound’s back—placed there by Hera! The potent toxin has sapped the demigod of his strength, but when rescued he is eager to help return the canine guard back to its rightful place.</p>\n<h1>Resolution</h1>\n<p>Once Cerberus has been controlled and the characters have returned to Kalogeros, an extravagant party, hosted by @Compendium[cycle-of-cerberus.npcs.zf4tLE5NHQLrz4ut]{Chiron}, is held in their honor. How the gods themselves reward the party for their heroics and crown them champions of Olympus is left up to the DM.</p>","img":"modules/cycle-of-cerberus/thumbs/L12.png"}
