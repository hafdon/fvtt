If the creature is unwilling it must succeed on a DC15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success its soul departs as normal. Additionally, if the creature is wearing any items or enchantments meant to trap or redirect the soul after death, such as a ring of mind shielding, the censer fails. A creature whose soul is trapped in the censer can only be restored to life by a wish spell, which removes the soul from the censer. The censer can hold a maximum of 10 souls.

On a failed save a random soul in the censer possess you, causing you to become incapacitated and lose control of your body. The soul now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. It can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. It is immune to being charmed or frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the soul ends it as a bonus action, or the soul is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell.
