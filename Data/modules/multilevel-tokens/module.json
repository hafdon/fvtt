  "description": "<p>Allows you to mark out linked regions on the map. Tokens present in the source region will be automatically cloned to the target region, and kept up-to-date with the original, mirroring movement and other changes.</p><p>Ideal for multi-level maps, for example so that tokens on a floor below are visible from a balcony above, and more!</p><p>Also adds a simple token teleportation system that works in a similar way.</p><p>See page at URL below for full usage instructions.</p>",
